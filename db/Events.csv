3,otherevent,Lessons from Lexecon: Battling Back Against Frivolous Securities Lawsuits,NULL,finLabs,"Securities litigation against corporate America could impact the economy as the fear of lawsuits by investors and the costs of defending them by companies divert capital away from productive uses, presenters at this roundtable discussion said.<p>""I've talked to investors from all over the world, and their deep concern is securities litigation,"" said Mickey Kantor, former U.S. Secretary of Commerce and now a partner in the law firm of Mayer, Brown & Platt. ""It strikes fear in their hearts.""<p>With investment driving the economic boom of the '90s in the U.S., the economy could suffer if investors are scared away from American companies because of the increase in class-action lawsuits alleging securities fraud.<p>""Without that investment, which can be inhibited by the fear of these kinds of lawsuits, we're going to shoot ourselves in the foot,"" said Kantor, who also served three years as U.S. Trade Representative.<p>To prevent this from happening, several things are needed &#151; from tort legislation and tougher judges to a legal strategy that fights these lawsuits based on sound economic research and theory, said members of the panel, who were also attorneys from Mayer, Brown & Platt, co-sponsor of the event.<p>The firm recently won a $50-million settlement in a lawsuit against Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes and Lerach, a New York law firm that has sued hundreds of companies on behalf of shareholders. Mayer, Brown & Platt sued the firm, accusing it of abusing the legal process by trying to destroy the reputation of Lexecon Inc., a consulting firm that has testified on behalf of companies sued by Milberg Weiss.<p>In April, a jury in Chicago awarded Lexecon $45 million in compensatory damages in the case. The two sides agreed to a $50 million settlement before the jury could decide on punitive damages.<p>The volume of securities class-action lawsuits in federal court has been climbing. Recent research described in a Policy Short published by the Milken Institute, ""The Economic Costs of Frivolous Securities Litigation,"" shows that in 1998, the number of such suits filed was close to one suit a day for every trading day that the stock market was open, breaking the record set in 1994. The research also shows that smaller companies &#151; those that are the fastest-growing in the country, such as high-tech firms &#151; are being sued more frequently than larger companies.<p>Alan N. Salpeter, the lead attorney in the Milberg Weiss case for Mayer, Brown & Platt, said the Lexecon victory should send a signal to corporate America that it needs to fight securities lawsuits, not just settle them.<p>""If everybody settles these cases, then we'll never make law in this area,"" said Salpeter. ""We'll never be able to fight back as a defense bar and establish some principals that are helpful. There's only so much that can be done in passing legislation. But there's a lot that can be done through the appellate process.""<p>One of the lessons of the Lexecon case, he added, is that it ""was clearly about someone who fought back.""<p>Other solutions offered by the panelists included:<p>When building a defense, lawyers must think of the economics of the case. Many factors cause stock prices to fall, he said. Build a strong economics case as to why the price fell.<p>Tort litigation. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 helped reduce the number of frivolous lawsuits, but the numbers are climbing back. New legislation is needed to curb these suits. 
Passing new laws is a long and difficult process, however, said two other speakers &#151; Philip R. Recht, former deputy administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration who joined Mayer, Brown & Platt this year, and Mark H. Gitenstein, former chief counsel to the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee who has been a partner with the firm since 1990.<p>They, along with Kantor, stressed the need for defense lawyers to be as aggressive as plaintiffs' attorneys have been in taking their case to politicians in Washington and Sacramento.<p>Gitenstein said he has learned four important lessons from his years in Washington:<p>""There has to be a good public policy reason for reform."" It's not just who you know, he said, but ""what you know"" that counts.<p>""You cannot do tort reform in Washington unless it is bipartisan.""<p>Be prepared for incremental reform. ""You can't go for the whole enchilada,"" he said. ""You're not going to get the whole enchilada.""<p>Broad reform is possible, but only when the issue is positioned in a way that ""the average American can understand it.""",NULL,,,,,,,,,6,14,1999,NULL,NULL,NULL,,"Milken Institute Conference Center <BR>

The Institute co-sponsored two conferences at Tel Aviv University in June 2002 that focused on two projects &#151; the cleanup of the Yarkon River and economic development in Tel Aviv.<p>

At the heart of both efforts are two of the Institute&#39;s top research priorities &#151; using private/public partnerships and innovative financial tools, not just government funds, to save the earth&#39;s ecosystems, and to increase economic development in the Middle East.<p>

The first conference, held June 10, examined a variety of financial tools that could help pay for the cleanup of the Yarkon River, Israel&#39;s second-largest river, which runs through seven different municipalities in the most densely populated area of Israel. Damage to the river includes water diversion, sewage outfall and habitat destruction.<p>

The conference, &quot;New Methods for Financing Environmental Projects in Israel / Case Study: Yarkon River Cleanup,&quot; brought together finance and environmental officials, academic experts and business leaders to look at ways to pay for rehabilitating the river, such as a mix of private and public funding.<p>

The day-long event was co-sponsored by the Tel Aviv-Los Angeles Partnership and the Recanti Graduate School of Business and the Porter School of Environmental Studies at Tel Aviv University. <p>

The second conference, &quot;Community Economic Development in Tel Aviv-Yafo,&quot; held June 13, focused on how to use private and public financing to fund urban development in Tel Aviv.<p>

It looked at the &quot;Genesis&quot; model in Los Angeles, which combines private and public financial tools for economic development, and how its successes could be transferred to initiatives in Tel Aviv.<p>

Among those speaking was Glenn Yago, Director of Capital Studies at the Milken Institute and a host of private and public officials from Israel. The event was co-sponsored by the Tel Aviv&#151;Los Angeles Partnership and the Tel Aviv Municipality.<p>

The Tel Aviv-Los Angeles Partnership is active in joint projects between the two cities in the areas of economic development, education, culture and others. Most recently, the Milken Institute and the Partnership worked together on creating a municipal bond to raise money for the construction of a parking lot in Tel Aviv &#151; the first of its kind of financing in Israel.<p>

Both of the Israeli efforts are tied to the wider work of the Institute&#39;s Capital Studies group on finding innovative financial solutions to help solve long-standing social, economic and environmental problems.",,,,,,,,,,6,2,2002,NULL,NULL,NULL,,"Tel Aviv, Israel",,0,0,,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,,"{length = 8, bytes = 0x0000000000240e12}",NULL,NULL,NULL,2005-10-21 10:30:22.000,2005-10-21 10:30:22.000,2002-06-02 00:00:00.000,NULL,NULL,37407,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

19,otherevent,The Asian Crisis Updated,NULL,finLabs,"The continuing financial crisis in Asia will not ease for at least another year, but if Japan undertakes needed reforms, we could see the economies of that region begin to turn around by the year 2000, <b>Marcus Noland</b> said in a speech at the Milken Institute.<p>Japan's economic health is critical to Asia's future. If it doesn't solve its financial problems, the rest of Asia probably won't solve theirs either, he warned.<p>""The real issue for the rest of Asia is Japan,"" said Noland, Senior Fellow at the Institute for International Economics in Washington, D.C. ""Japan is key to a speedy and constructive resolution of the crisis.""<p>During his talk to about 150 guests at the Institute, Noland highlighted Japan's problems:<p>- An estimated growth rate this year of between minus-2 percent and minus-3 percent.<p>- Rising unemployment among the core male population.<p>- An increase in precautionary savings.<p>- The flight of deposits from commercial banks to government-run institutions.<p>Noland offered several solutions:<p>1. To stimulate demand for goods, Japan should establish a finite inflationary target and then ""simply print money until it is reached"" - an idea, he concedes, that does not have many supporters in Japan.<p>2. Japan must follow through on its promises to spend public money to stimulate the economy - and spend that money wisely. ""There have been so many special packages, so many stimulus plans and so many supplementary budgets in the last 15 years that haven't amounted to much that no one actually believes them,"" Noland said. So when the government announces, as it recently did, a 10-trillion yen stimulus package, he expects it to actually spend about 3 trillion yen.<p>3. Japan must act aggressively to shut down insolvent banks and pay off bad loans, which some estimate as high as $1.5 trillion. The government recently earmarked 60 trillion yen (about $500 billion) to fix the problem, a decision praised by Noland. But, historically, the government has been reluctant to implement such plans. ""The government doesn't want to act aggressively, because it fears that if it aggressively tries to shut insolvent banks that it will exacerbate a credit crunch. And it also wants to protect its friends,"" Noland said.<p>Because of this reluctance, Japan runs a risk of making things worse.<p>""Given the set of institutions, incentives and corporate governance practices that their economy operates under, one runs the risk of simply recapitalizing a flawed system and setting yourself up to exacerbate the crisis somewhere further down the road with a public that would, understandably, be even less willing to pay the bill,"" Noland said.<p>Fortunately for Japan, it is stable and has many resources at its disposal. The rest of Asia isn't so fortunate. South Korea, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines have all suffered tremendous economic losses due to fiscal, regulatory and political problems. Unfortunately, righting Japan's economy may cause further damage to some of these countries - especially South Korea. A devaluation of the yen, for example, would cost Korea exports not only to Japan, but also to other countries like the United States as Japanese goods became more competitive.<p>Noland also touched on these problems:<p>- The U.S. trade deficit could reach $300 billion this year. While that is not a problem at the moment, it could become a big problem later. ""If the U.S. economy weakens, the trade deficit could rise in terms of political salience in the U.S. And if Japan has not pulled out of its recession by the time the United States economy weakens, then the world economy could truly be a mess,"" Noland said.<p>- China, while not as bad off as the rest of Asia, still faces many problems, including its own poor banking system and the transition of state-owned enterprises to the private sector. A devaluation of some type can be expected from China next year.<p>Without a healthy Japan, however, the rest of Asia cannot recover, Noland said. Even the $30-billion stimulus package recently announced by Japan to revive the economies of other Asian countries will go only so far. ""Restoring robust growth in Japan would be more desirable,"" Noland said. And that will take time.<p>""This is going to be a slog,"" Noland said. ""This is unlikely to turn around quickly. I don't think one can have any real confidence in positive growth until 2000.""<p>Noland is one of the nation's most preeminent scholars of East Asian economies.

In other industries, such as small drug manufacturers, regulations threaten their ability to compete with larger companies.<p>""Right now, the whole mood toward regulatory reform is at an ebb,"" said Smith, president and founder of the Competitive Enterprise Institute. ""The forces favoring greater regulation are having a bit of a renaissance.""<p>It is time for Congress to control this regulatory fever. The U.S. should treat regulations the way it treats the federal budget - Congress must authorize it and the president must sign it into law. Lawmakers cannot continue to allow each agency to impose whatever controls it wants, with little oversight, he said.<p>""It's becoming recognized that it's something that has to happen,"" said Smith. ""Over the next 20 years, we will have some form of regulatory accountability, which will essentially mean that regulations will be included in a more precise way in the U.S. budget. I think that will lead to a view that regulations can be promulgated by agencies, but they don't become law until Congress and the president sign them into law. That's a kind of tool that would attract bipartisan support over time.""<p>Lack of accountability is just one problem with current regulations, he said. The other is a feeling by many agencies that anything new is risky, such as medicines or the Internet. The problem with that way of thinking, he said, is that it inhibits progress.<p>""There are risks of going too quickly into the future, but there are also risks of staying too long in the past,"" he said.<p>Smith pointed out two areas in particular that are hurt by too much regulation. One is in biotechnology. In many ways it is similar to the computer industry, where bright entrepreneurs push the boundaries of technology. The difference, however, is that the computer industry has few regulations while biotechnology has many.<p>""One of them produces a Bill Gates, the other hasn't produced much wealth at all,"" Smith said. ""One of the reasons is a Steve Jobs or Steve Wozniak can start off with a brilliant idea, develop it in their garage and then, if it really works, attract capital and go out and become incredibly wealthy. A biotech firm can start with its product in a small lab, but when it wants to take the next step and become a marketable product, it has a real impediment, because it has to go through the regulatory process.""<p>The other area where regulations hurt is trade, where the end of the Cold War has resulted in the United States demanding more from its partners. With the Soviet Union in power, we dealt with the world ""on its own terms,"" which sometimes meant dealing with countries with poor human rights records or repressive leaders. ""With the Cold War over, in America in particular, a lot of utopian fantasies have been freed,"" he said.<p>Groups as diverse as Greenpeace and the Christian Coalition are trying to impose their moral beliefs on the rest of the world through federal trade policies, which jeopardizes our commerce with the world, Smith said.<p>""The risk with this new world is that protectionism will become a moral thing to do - 'Yes, we'll trade with Burma as soon as they have wonderful human rights.' These are areas that are not going to be easy to achieve and they create incredible backlash potential among the rest of the world.""<p>Smith is the president and founder of the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a public interest group that promotes market-based solutions to economic and environmental public policy issues.

But while the problems are vast and difficult, its leadership appears to be working hard to prevent them from becoming major catastrophes - and in many cases is succeeding, the speakers said.<p>""What we're seeing in China today is a leadership that is struggling with enormous problems,"" said <b>Barry Naughton</b>, a professor in International Relations and Pacific Studies at the University of California, San Diego. ""It might still be swamped by these problems, but so far, from everything we can see, it is maneuvering to keep a very dramatic forward momentum going on.""<p>

One of the most recent signs is China's concessions on negotiations for entry into the World Trade Organization, he said.<p>

""It is a very large and very important package of concessions by the Chinese that has the effect of opening Chinese markets in very important ways to outside business,"" Naughton said. ""I would say this WTO agreement represents a recognition that government-sponsored attempts to restructure industry in a planned way aren't working, and the only thing that works in China, and that the only thing that's going to work in the future, is to ratchet up the degree of competition, ratchet up the degree of economic change.""<p>

Naughton was one of three speakers who addressed an audience at the Milken Institute Conference Center on, ""China in Transition: Social & Economic Challenges."" The event was co-sponsored by the Asia Society, the Milken Institute and the USC-UCLA Center for East Asian Studies. The event was moderated by James Tong, co-director of the center and a professor of political science at UCLA.<p>

All three speakers pointed to large-scale problems facing China's leadership, from vast environmental pollution to rural poverty.<p>Vaclav Smil, professor of geography at the University of Manitoba, said China faces terrible problems of air pollution, soil degradation and water shortages - all of which spell trouble for China's ability to feed itself.<p>

With so many mouths to feed, and with only a limited amount of food available on the world market, China has no choice but to grow its own crops to feed its people.<p>But, he said, ""You have to have a reasonably healthy environment to do that.""<p>

<b>Anthony Saich</b>, resident representative of the Ford Foundation in Beijing and Daewoo Professor of International Affairs at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, said that rural poverty remains one of China's biggest problems.<p>

""The long-term future of China resides in resolving very deep-seated rural problems,"" Saich said. ""It's still where 80 percent of the population lives, and it's where domestic demand will eventually have to be stimulated to keep the Chinese economy moving along.""<p>

As the Chinese leadership struggles with these problems, it is faced with many dilemmas, the speakers said. One of the most difficult is being able to reduce the country's massive state-run enterprises while maintaining its strong growth rate, Naughton said.<p>

""In order to continue this process, (Prime Minister) Zhu Rongji needs to be able to hold out to the workers who are being laid off the possibility, the promise that they'll find some other kind of work, some new occupation, that they're not just going to be cast aside on the ash heap of history,"" he said. ""Zhu Rongji needs to keep the growth rate up.""<p>

To do this, the prime minister has injected government money into various infrastructure projects.<p>

""The reason this is a dilemma is that in doing so, Zhu Rongji is inevitably working at cross-purposes,"" he said. ""The money that gets pumped from the state into infrastructure projects inevitably goes primarily back into the state sector. So on the one hand, Zhu is shrinking down the state sector by intensifying market competition. On the other hand, he is propping it up by pouring government funds into a large-scale investment program.""<p>

""That's a set of choices that is easy to criticize,"" Naughton added, ""but it's hard to figure out what he should do that's a whole lot better.""",NULL,,,,,,,,,4,29,1999,NULL,NULL,NULL,,"Milken Institute Conference Center <BR>

""It is incumbent on them to respond positively to our overtures so that we can together create a new paradigm for peaceful coexistence and respect.""<p>Lee's talk came one day before U.S. special envoy William Perry arrived in North Korea for talks meant to persuade its leaders to abandon their nuclear weapons and missile programs in exchange for a package of economic and diplomatic benefits.<p>Perry brought with him a joint message from the U.S., South Korea and Japan, which have worked on a package of incentives to encourage the North to end its weapons programs.<p>Lee said the package is part of a strategy of engagement with North Korea that his country hopes will finally persuade the communist regime to turn from confrontation to peace with its neighbors.<p>""We believe the package deal presents the North Korean regime with its best chance for survival,"" said Lee, pointing to the North's numerous economic problems. ""It may be their last chance as well.""<p>Also speaking at the event were Hilton Root, a senior fellow at the Milken Institute, and Ci-Wook Shin, a professor of sociology at UCLA.<p><b>Hilton Root</b><br>Root discussed his recent report, ""The New Korea: Crisis Brings Opportunity,"" which proposes that compromises be made by the three major sectors in South Korea - the giant chaebols, labor and finance - so that needed economic reforms can go forward.<p>""Labor markets, enterprise markets and financial markets are part of an integrated social bargain in Korea,"" Root said. ""People there understand these as related, not as separate.""<p>Unfortunately, the International Monetary Fund only looked at financial reforms when it helped out the South Korean government in 1997.<p>""The IMF failed to understand that reforms must include all three sectors at once if changes are to occur, and as a result, the necessary reforms have not taken place,"" Root said.<p>Despite these failures, Root said there is room for optimism.<p>""There still needs to be an integrated settlement. There still needs to be a meeting of labor with management and with the capital markets, the banks, the IMF and the president in which there are tradeoffs, in which different groups make concessions, because all of these three groups hold part of the power,"" he said. ""Nothing will happen if one works exclusively with one of these groups and not with all three at the same time.""<p><b>Ci-Wook Shin</b><br>Shin spoke on social crises affecting South Korea that, despite some recent good news about that country's economy, remain serious problems.<p>""If you read Korean newspapers these days, you may get the impression that the crisis may be over,"" he said. ""Stock prices went up. Some people are expecting growth of 4 to 5 percent this year. But if you talk to people in Korea, you get a more conflicting picture. You get the impression that the crisis is far from over.""<p>Among the most serious problems is unemployment, now at between 8 and 9 percent - very high by Korean standards.<p>""Jobs are more than just about simply making money. The workplace is a place for social occasions,"" he said. ""Losing a job is more than simply losing a means to make money, but also losing your social worth.""<p>As a result of this high unemployment, labor unions are in trouble. They have lost public support.<p>""The labor movement is at a crossroads. It is facing a very tough challenge,"" he said. It must shore up its support, while being careful not to take actions that hurt its interests.<p>""Any miscalculation may facilitate the demise of labor activism in South Korea,"" he said.

""Forces and trends are converging that will transform California into a very different state from the one we know today.""<p>

The rapid change and population growth California is experiencing are expected to continue unhindered. The regional balance of power will shift form the urban coastal areas inland to the Central Valley, the Inland Empire and Orange County. The dominant ethnic group will be Latino. Most Californians believe that today's elected officials are ill equipped to develop public policy suited to cope with the volatile growth and change California is facing.<p>

Baldassare examines California's economic, demographic and political underpinnings in light of three factors profoundly affecting the state: political distrust, racial and ethnic change, and regional diversity. These divisions will make it increasingly difficult to reach a consensus on public policy issues facing California as the state prepares for the future.<p>

50,otherevent,Corporate Debt and the Technology Shock,NULL,finLabs,"Thanks to rapid advancements in technology, the U.S. economy continues pushing to new heights, but while this growth may continue, the risks to investors have also grown, two economists said in a talk at the Milken Institute.<p>

""Technology is driving economic growth, not just in the United States, but by extension, in the world,"" said <b>David Goldman</b>, Global Credit Strategist for Credit Suisse First Boston. ""It will continue to do so because of the unleashed forces that no force on earth can stop.""<p>

The ""technology shock,"" as Goldman calls it, has turned the investment world upside down. Price-to-earnings ratios have skyrocketed; companies that used to be secure, low-risk have become more volatile as they enter the high-tech market; and as the stock market continues to go up, volatility has gone up, too - exactly the opposite of what has occurred historically.<p>

All of these rapid changes have made life more unpredictable for investors.<p>

""We're in a world such as has never been seen before,"" Goldman said. ""People are getting better stock returns, but feeling more and more nervous about it. This is an anomalous event.""<p>

The American economy is so dependent on stock market gains from the high-tech sector that poor earnings could threaten the overall economy - and that has created uncertainty around the world.<p>

""The American consumer is spending, to some extent, capital gains out of her stock portfolio,"" Goldman said. ""Consumption is very much dependent on the stock market, and the stock market is dependent on these kinds of valuations. This makes the world a riskier place. It means that although growth has been stronger than any of us forecast, it's a narrowly based growth, and one based on sources that are difficult to understand.""<p>

One result of this volatility is that high-yield debt may be a safer investment than investment-grade debt, he said. The default rate for high-yield bonds is the lowest it has ever been.<p>

Although there are certain indicators that economists can use to gauge the market - with the volatility of stock prices and the cost of hedging equity prices being two of the most important - there are still many uncertainties, Goldman said.<p>

""The high-yield debt market is between fear and greed,"" he said. ""We're likely to continue with that kind of very odd, not quite knowing how to look at the market for some time.""<p>

<b>Bob Kricheff</b>, Managing Director at CS First Boston, highlighted some of the technology areas that are particularly active today, such as cable television, the Internet, and telecommunications. He said the high-yield market is feeding much of their growth.<p>

""The high-yield market really does not act without the major technology sectors and vice versa,"" he said. ""They're closely linked.""<p>

To show how much technology industries have restructured the high-yield market, Kricheff pointed to statistics that showed that in 1992, this area made up 13 percent of the market. Today, it makes up 30 percent.<p>

""It's creating some phenomenal opportunities for wealth, some phenomenal opportunities for productivity, and some phenomenal opportunities for employment,"" he said.<p>

But he added the same cautious note as Goldman about the risks of such a rapidly changing and popular market.<p>

""What worries me is people blindly investing money in everything that ends with a dot-com.""<p>

He said investors should keep in mind four things:<p>
<ul>
<li>The technology area is made up not of just one, but many sectors.<br>
<li>Rapid change is the norm, so don't get trapped in ""old world views"" and get stuck on one theme or one company.<br>
<li>Don't focus on a company's assets, but how well they execute their business plan.<br>
<li> Focus on customers; they are the key to this industry.
</li>
</ul>
<p>

""Everybody gets tied up in the technology,"" Kricheff said. ""That is what's changing the economy. But at the end of the day, it's not necessarily what's driving businesses. It's still a lot of execution and focus and winning customers and revenue.""",NULL,,,,,,,,,5,4,1999,NULL,NULL,NULL,,"Milken Institute Conference Center <BR>

In this talk, Nobel Laureate <b>George A. Olah</b> of the University of Southern California presents his views on how societal needs as well as major environmental concerns can be solved through the efforts of science and science-based technology. In particular, he will touch on issues related to his area of interest, chemistry, such as our reliance on limited and decreasing fossil fuel reserves and global warming caused by excess carbon dioxide formed through the burning of these fuels. One possible solution that has been suggested is to chemically recycle excess carbon dioxide into useful fuels, making us independent of oil and gas, and at the same time helping to mitigate global warming. Other topics for the talk include the gasoline additive MTBE and the insecticide DDT.<p>

The IEM are on-line futures markets operated by faculty at the University of Iowa College of Business. The idea behind them is that people will efficiently evaluate and act on information that will affect their ""trades."" Their conclusions are revealed through the market's prices.

Thanks to globalization, technological change and a new generation of Israelis and Arabs, the dynamics of the region are changing, he said.<p>

""The nature of peace has changed,"" said Peres, Minister of Regional Development in the current government. ""You cannot have any more diplomatic peace. You must have economic peace."" <p>

Peres was at the Institute to learn more about the Institute's research on the economy of Israel and the region. Over the past few years, the Milken Institute has engaged in research and development concerning financial innovations to assist in Israeli economic development.<p>

During a roundtable discussion with a group of prominent local business executives and public officials, Peres told them that his generation - which built the modern Jewish state - is seeing major changes take place in the region.<p>

""The whole landscape of leadership in the area is of an old age, irrelevant to a new epoch coming in our lives,"" he said. The new generation of Israeli's and Arabs is more worried about jobs and getting a good education than tanks and borders. <p>

""They don't understand why they should be stopped at borders, why they should kill or be killed,"" Peres said. ""What for? You cannot explain it to them.""<p>

The impetus behind these changes is globalization and technology, which Peres said has resulted in three separate economies:<p>


<b>*The Global Economy:</b> This economy knows no borders or distance. There is a lot of competition, and only those with the most creative ideas and best technology will win, he said. ""It is detached from geography, and connected entirely with science, technology and information.""<p><p>

<b>*The Regional Economy:</b> Israel's economic future is tied to its neighbors, so it's important to help them. ""For our own existence, we must understand that we can't be an island of wealth in a sea of poverty, an island of cleanliness in a sea of pollution, or an island of security in a sea of violence and terror. Our interest in our neighbors is essential for our own existence.""<p>

<b>*The National Economy:</b> Education is the key to Israel's economic future, and the government is planning to spend much more on schools in the near future. ""The country with the best education system will be the winning country,"" he said.<p><p>

For the region to succeed, money must be spent wisely - on schools, infrastructure, tourism and other vital areas. It cannot continue to go to the same old sources decided upon by central governments. It needs to go to regional development and businesses, he said.<p>

He cited Europe's planned spending of $6 billion in the Middle East as an example of good intentions gone bad, since the money will go to the same central governments that have received funds before, not to the needs of today's new economy.<p>

""They're collecting money from the poor in the rich countries and giving it to the rich in poor countries,"" he said. Instead, the money should go to such critical needs as roads, water pipes, tourism and education. <p>

""Give this money on a regional basis to every enterprise that wants to develop tourism, education, water and infrastructure,"" he said. ""And the government will use its money for two purposes - to guarantee the investment and to reduce the cost of capital. <p>

""Use the money for these purposes and you will change the Middle East,"" he said. <p>

He added that it's important to build all economies in the region, Arab and Israeli alike. <p>

""If they remain poor, we will not have peace,"" he said of Israel's neighbors. And, he added, ""Peace will not be done in the police stations. It will be done at universities.""",NULL,,,,,,,,,1,12,2000,NULL,NULL,NULL,,"Milken Institute Conference Center <BR>

78,otherevent_78,Democratizing Capital in the United States,NULL,Forums,"The starting point for this two-day symposium, ""Democratizing Capital in U.S. History, Business, and Public Policy,"" was the question, What has happened to the goal of combining a capitalist economy with democracy? To answer this question the symposium explored converging themes in American history related to the democratization of capital. We examined from an historical perspective the notion that popular access to capital in a capitalist economy translates to democratic values in a polity. We also considered how that idea developed as the nation's social and economic structure changed from the 19th century to the present day.

<P>
 
<B>The Issues</b>
<P>
Two days of roundtable discussions addressed the question along several lines:
<P>
<B> The history of capital access</B> The ideal of a society of independent farmers, proprietors, and craftsmen - economically independent producers of wealth - was propounded from the time of the nation's founding through the mid-19th century. It was thought that the wide distribution of ownership of productive assets would form the basis for democratic participation. Could this goal of ""democratic capitalism"" survive the industrial revolution?
<P>
<B>Populism and labor movements</B> The 20th century arrived on a wave of progressive reforms as the needs of mass production drove capital into the hands of a few. Did the redistribution of wealth through the welfare state supply a new means of sharing capital broadly? What issues raised during the populist/progressive era resonate in today's policy debates?
<P>
<B>Democratizing financial institutions</B> Access to capital increased through the growth of finance and saving options. A.P. Giannini was one of the first bankers to lend to average citizens instead of just to corporations; he also invented the modern mortgage system, propelling home ownership. How did this focus on providing small-scale financial services to individual consumers impact American economic and political life?
<P>
<B>Financial technologies</B> How did 20th-century financial innovations - such as employee ownership of large corporations, greater access to funding for new businesses, and broader participation in the stock and bond markets - affect the role of Americans in the economy and in politics?
<P>
<B>The New Deal and the Reagan era</B> Roosevelt and Reagan entered office confronting dire economic challenges: the former, a credit crunch in tailspin; the latter, a stagnant economy and concentrated corporate power. How did the policies of these administrations compare and contrast in their prescriptions for recovery and growth?
<P>
<B>Shared capitalism and ownership</B> Could employee buyouts of corporations start a new trend in capitalism - or even eliminate the problem of struggle between owners and laborers? Will the merging of these roles bring about a peaceful democratization of capital in an industrial, technology-driven world? Will the political influence of workers and owners equalize?
<P>
<B>Community capitalism</B> How do institutions like community development banks empower the disenfranchised on a local basis?
<P>
<B>Democratizing economic policy</B> What policies can the U.S. government adopt to further develop all Americans' access to capital, and, in turn, meaningful participation in the political process?
<P>

 

 
<b>The Sessions</b>
<P>
The program for this small but important symposium consisted of seven roundtable discussions which addressed both historical developments in capital access and their policy implications in the present day. Also featured was a luncheon presentation on the democratization of capital and financial technologies.<P>
<B>The Audience</B><P>

Our audience of approximately 100 included historians and practitioners in politics, economics, business, and labor as well as key policymakers and media.

80,otherevent,Examination of S&Ls Roundtable,NULL,finLabs,"<B>What Can an Examination of S&Ls Reveal About Financial Institutions, Markets and Regulation?</B><P>
Some 50 specialists in financial services gathered at the UCLA Faculty Center on January 25, 2002, to assess the lessons of the 1980s S&L mess for financial institutions, markets and regulation in the years ahead. The give and take at the invitation-only meeting, co-hosted by the Milken Institute and UCLA's Anderson School of Management, reflected the diverse backgrounds of the participants. Some argued that today's financial markets are in much better shape than they were 20 years ago, while others asserted that not nearly enough has been done to prevent future problems. The glass-is-half-full view was expressed most clearly by James Wilcox of the University of California's Haas School of Business. Among the lessons learned:<P> 

<B>The value of diversification</B><P> 
We have seen what happens when institutions are not permitted to diversify their investments. Diversification across sectors, geographic regions and services, all make a difference.<P> 

<B>The need for risk management</B><P> 
We now have a much better understanding of how much interest rate and credit risk are in the system, and how these risks can be handled. Financial institutions have more latitude to hedge now than they did 20 years ago.<p> 

<B>The imperative for closure</B><P>
Instead of letting firms try to grow out of problems, we should opt for ""reincarnation"" &#151; reorganizing struggling institutions, bringing them back with different managers, different owners and perhaps different balance sheets. Other participants, including Susanne Trimbath of the Milken Institute, were less sanguine. In the long term, she noted, the share of U.S. financial assets held by banks and thrifts is falling. ""We might well look to pension funds and mutual funds as the next set of institutions to become vulnerable if a conflict arises between asset classes and market conditions,"" she argued. A forced divestment of company stock from pension plans, for example, could leave those financial institutions vulnerable.<P>

""Exactly the same things happened in Superior,"" a recently failed Chicago thrift, as happened in the 1980s, seconded George Kaufman of the Center for Financial Studies & Policy at Loyola University. Kaufman appends to Santayana's admonition that those who forget history are bound to repeat it.<P>

""What do those who do remember do? They agonize first and then do it again.""<P> To focus the discussion, the day included sessions on government policy, the public record, and the parallels in international banking. The final session summarized the day's discussion.<P>


<B>Government policy: were there unintended consequences?</B><P>

Government policy left S&Ls vulnerable to shifting market forces, including interest rate volatility, deteriorating asset quality and increasing industry competition. ""Public policy at the time included a rigid institutional design,"" explained Glenn Yago, director of capital studies at the Milken Institute. ""That design inhibited the ability of S&Ls to adapt to technological developments, federal and state deregulation that came after the industry was in serious trouble, and tax law changes that weakened the financial condition of savings and loan institutions by adversely affecting real estate values.""<P>
<B>Public record: was there fair and accurate coverage?</B><P>

News coverage mediates society's understanding of events and often becomes the accepted history. The media frames the coverage, promoting certain issues as problematic, certain outcomes as undesirable, and certain strategies as inappropriate. In representing the S&L industry in the 1980s, it generally failed to go beyond terms like ""crisis"" and ""bailout,"" which fit into 30-second sound bites. ""Catch a crook"" attracted more attention than how thrifts could fulfill their historical mission to ""build a house.""<P>
Martin Regalia of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce reminded the conferees that ""for the most part, newspapers are not the guardians or watchdogs of our society, but just another business trying to make a buck. And that is not all bad.""<P>

<B>U.S. S&L experience: are there parallels in other countries?</B><P>
The problems of financial institutions in the 1980s anticipated or paralleled those of other countries. When problems occur here, U.S. analysts prefer to look to unique circumstances or the failings of individuals. When problems occur elsewhere, they find systemic causes with simple solutions.<P>

But what happened to the S&Ls was not so different from financial disruptions that occurred overseas both before and after the 1980s. For example, James Barth of the Milken Institute points out that ""S&Ls were essentially directed toward the politically motivated investments in residential real estate."" Equivalent policy-directed investments are common in other countries with state-owned or controlled financial systems.<P>

<B>Summing up: do S&Ls provide a useful perspective?</B><P>
The 1980s witnessed the collision of vulnerable financial institutions with frenetic regulatory policy. An examination of the portfolios of institutions that invested in similar assets shows that the S&Ls were treated differently in a systematic way. Banks were underwater at the same time as thrifts, yet the banks were not closed. The seizure of S&L assets amounted to an extraordinarily large &#151; perhaps the largest ever &#151; nationalization of private assets. The S&L case was more visible than other examples of policy mixing poorly with markets because government deposit insurance put the S&Ls in a very visible position. Government- insured institutions were naturally subject to political competition over who was to blame for their demise. But looking below the surface, the similarities in these conflicts generally exceed the differences.<P>

Future roundtables in the series will focus on different forms of financial institutions and different types of asset classes. The conferences will be represented in a book series from Kluwer Academic Publishers, the Milken Institute Series on Financial Innovation and Economic Growth.<P>

The Milken Institute Forum was one of a series of events held during the week by NEPAD supporters.<P>

Lindiwe Hendricks, South Africa's Deputy Minister of Trade and Industry, told the audience that the key to NEPAD's future is that it was created by and for Africans. But, she added, it will take international support and partnerships to succeed.<P>

Among the issues discussed were Africa's debt, health problems, foreign investment, economic growth and other challenges and opportunities.<P>

In general, application of financial technology on the Internet is relatively unsophisticated. While we do find the first examples of auctions, exchanges, barter and simple market concepts, these examples have little of the sophistication (or liquidity) found in modern financial markets.  Conversely, until the emergence of the Internet, opportunities to apply financial technology more broadly (taking technology from the financial community and applying it to non-financial markets) have been constrained. Recent advances in the evolution of Internet markets indicate that application of financial technologies to a new set of transactions holds significant promise for accelerating the evolution of electronic commerce. <P>

Participants were an invited group of industry, academic, and policy experts whose backgrounds encompass a wide variety of expertise and approaches.

In a sober but upbeat assessment of the state's future, speakers said the current economic downturn will last for several quarters, but expressed confidence that Cal  
<P>
""While we do have a bumpy road ahead of us - probably for the next 10 to 12 months - confidence, innovation, immigrant spirit and just the courage and resolve to see our way through this will get us through,"" said Gov. Gray Davis, who gave a special afternoon presentation. Ifornia will come out of it in the second-half of 2002.
<P>
More than 400 business and financial leaders, government officials, economists and media attended the day-long event that focused on some of the state's key assets - its diversity, technological prowess, entertainment industry and entrepreneurial talent - while also pointing out the need to solve some long-standing problems such as housing costs and energy needs.
<P>
State Treasurer Philip Angelides, the conference's keynote speaker, summed up the day's outlook by telling the audience about the many challenges facing the state today because of the recession and September 11 terrorist attacks that have turned the state's budget surplus into a deficit of between $8 billion and $14 billion, but emphasizing that they are only temporary roadblocks.
<P>
""Despite our current challenges, I believe we are on the verge of a great era in California, which will secure our preeminence in the global marketplace - if we approach these times of stress with confidence and vision,"" Angelides said. ""I believe we can sustain the California dream in the 21st century if we summon the strength at this time of crisis to invest anew in our economy and our people.""
<P>
The day included sessions on energy, entertainment, demography, Internet and financing, and ended with a special Q & A with the audience and Milken Institute economists.<P>

93,otherevent,Springboard Enterprises Bootcamp,NULL,finLabs,"As part of its ongoing efforts to support programs for entrepreneurs and encourage investment in markets that stimulate the economy, the Milken Institute hosted a workshop by Springboard Enterprises on Dec. 5, designed to prepare and connect women-led businesses to investors in the equity capital markets.<P>

The in-depth, one-day ""BootCamp"" brought together more than 50 women entrepreneurs and local business people to talk about how to raise needed capital for their growing firms. It included a talk by Katrina Garnett, founder of CrossWorlds Software, case studies, panel discussions with leading industry experts and a fast-pitch session highlighting four local entrepreneurs.<P>    

Garnett, Managing Director of Garnett Capital, opened the program. She drew from her own inspiring story to illustrate to the audience how to map out their course, detect opportunity to create a new space in the marketplace, stay afloat financially and be flexible when the need arises. Her key pieces of advice were to file patents early on and find the right niche. She also discussed the importance of educating the market about your company's product and knowing how to use the media. Other key points: raise money before you need it, know everyone &#151; customers, analysts and vendors &#151; and let your customers speak for your brand to bring you credibility. In sum, she said, know your vision, execute in phases and have an exit strategy.<P>

Don Fracchia of Wells Fargo Bank spoke about raising capital in general terms. Wells Fargo has long been a small-business friendly bank, said Fracchia, and he advised the attendees to show discipline, focus and have a plan beyond their entrepreneurial vision and passion.<P>  

Three brass-tacks panels filled the next several hours. The first, moderated by Betsy Zeidman, head of the Milken Institute's Emerging Domestic Markets Program, discussed the key elements of a growth business. The panelists represented venture capital, banking, law and accounting, and included a former Springboard participant. They discussed financing models and how to assess the competition so that your product stands out above the rest. Their key points: analyze and evaluate the competition as well as barriers to sale, bring in a team that can execute and be credible.<P>

The next panel took it one step further: doing the deal. The panelists focused on due diligence, good connections and good corporate housekeeping. They touched on the structure of different deals and stressed the importance of knowing which fund is the right one for your business. Most of all, they agreed, be patient.<P>

The lunch session, moderated by the Milken Institute's Director of Capital Studies, Glenn Yago, discussed today's economic realities &#151; investors are now looking for companies with high margins, typically 45 to 65 percent, with experienced management teams. The definition of ""early stage"" financing has migrated upward and investors expect significant milestones before considering a firm. Again, infrastructure, a solid business base and good corporate governance were at the forefront. But investors are still interested in good ideas and consumer product companies. When it came to where the capital would come from, a common theme emerged: match your company's needs with the right fund.<P> 

The day then shifted from panel discussions to a case study of a successful woman-led firm, SatisFusion, presented by its chairman, Fay Wood. She was followed by four fast pitches presented by local entrepreneurs who were treated to feedback by a panel of investors.<P>

98,otherevent_98,Education's Challenge: The Jobs Skills Mismatch,NULL,Forums,"The Milken Family Foundation's National Education Conference examined significant issues in education, and provided an opportunity for honorees to share their ideas with one another and with other distinguished representatives from academia, government, business, and local communities. The event culminated with the recognition of K-12 educators from across the United States for their teaching, leadership, and contribution to the healthy development of children. <P>

As its part of the conference, the Milken Institute held a panel discussion Friday, June 26, ""Education's Challenge: The Jobs and Skills Mismatch,"" that examined the disparity between the skills of the labor force and the requirements of today's job market. Institute Chairman Michael Milken moderated.<P>
 
<B>The Issues</B><P>

The American economy has undergone extraordinary change over the last decade, driven by technology and global competition. With some industries expanding rapidly while others are contracting, the consequences for labor markets and our educational system are profound. Technology is at the heart of a growing mismatch between the skills possessed by our labor force and the mix of skills demanded by employers. What is to be made of this? <P>

The program consisted of two sessions:<P>

<B>The Professionals' Perspective.</B> This session, which featured experts who study education and labor, looked at how our education system is serving the changing needs of the American economy.<P>

The answer? Not as well as it must if American companies are going to successfully compete in the 21st century global market. <P>

Today's workplace is changing so rapidly, that even in today's strong U.S. economy, companies are going begging for skilled, talented workers. One of the critical problems is that many people don't have the skills necessary to succeed in today's ""knowledge economy,"" which values skills like problem solving and communication much more highly than ever, they said.<P>

""The new economy is knowledge-biased,"" said James O'Connell, Vice President of government relations and human resources policy for the Ceridian Corp. ""It gives tremendous advantage to those who have knowledge and a tremendous disadvantage to those who don't. In this economy, knowledge is power.""<P>

Laurie Bassi, Vice President for research at the American Society for Training and Development, agreed. ""We are now well into the 'knowledge' era, and in this era, it is human capital that defines privilege and wealth, and the absence of human capital that defines poverty,"" she said.<P>

Bassi presented a chart showing the work attributes that are ""in"" and ""out"" in today's workplace. On the list of ""ins"" were: brains, mental dexterity, access to memory and integration of skills and tasks. On the ""out"" list were: brawn, manual dexterity, memorization and compartmentalization. ""What we need is an education system that is defined by the attributes on the 'in' list,"" she said. ""What worked well in education for hundreds of years for the majority of people who would become the workforce is now a detriment, not an asset.""<P>

She and other panelists told the hundreds of educators gathered for the talk that they must change the way they teach if young people are going to succeed. The panelists stressed that traditional fact-based, test-taking classrooms won't help students when it comes time to get jobs in the new workplace.<P>

""Both current entry-level and future entry-level employees need to be intelligent, skilled, thoughtful, able to problem-solve, able to communicate with each other and be able to work together in teams,"" said Michael Templeton, a consultant in science learning.<P>

Richard McGahey, Assistant Secretary for Policy for the U.S. Department of Labor, told the gathering that jobs are changing so fast today that even in industries such as auto making, the skills required are dramatically different than in years past. ""Fewer than half of the high school graduates in the United States currently have the mathematics skills to get a job in an auto plant,"" he said.<P>

Milken Institute Economist Alec Levenson said many people in the U.S. today don't have the basic skills necessary for such things as locating an intersection on a street map or using a calculator. These workers must be given a proper foundation of reading, writing and math. Without that, the more critical skills needed in today's economy won't be possible.<P>

Slides were presented showing how rapidly jobs are changing in the world today, with some of today's growth leaders being the computer industry, pharmaceutical companies and financial firms. The point, said Donald Straszheim, president of the Institute, is that, ""Not only do the employers change, but the nature of the jobs change as well. That's the constant challenge of the whole education system.""<P>

<B>The Practitioners' Perspective.</B> This session looked at the problem from the business sector's point of view.<P>

They had two key messages:<P>

One, companies are desperate for intelligent, professional workers with strong people skills, technological skills and the ability to think independently and creatively in the work environment.<P>

Two, businesses must work with educators to create a plan for teaching students so they will have the skills necessary in the changing workplace.<P>

Roger Brossy, of Sibson & Co. said three areas in particular cause great concern to businesses today: 1. They cannot find enough qualified individuals to handle technological matters, such as writing code or computer programs. 2. The service sector cannot find enough good workers. And 3. They cannot find enough talented executives. ""The best performing companies today are paranoid that they have an insufficient level of executive talent,"" Brossy said. That's one reason the search business, or executive head-hunters, has grown by 550 percent in the past 15 years, he said.<P>

Jerry Jasinowski, President/CEO of the National Association of Manufacturers, said among his members, training employees to handle work in the ""knowledge"" economy is the number one priority. ""If we want to continue on the successful growth path, we have to elevate the quality of knowledge within our people to a higher level than it is,"" he said.<P>

What's critical, said Ray Marcy, Chairman, President and CEO of Interim Services Inc., is ""how we educate, not just what we educate.""<P>

Sharon Feldman, vice president of employee relations at Warner Bros., said the skills that her company and other businesses need are simple: workers must have basic reading, writing and math skills; must be computer literate; must be able to assimilate into the corporate culture; and be a team player.<P>

The second part of the discussion focused on what government and businesses can do to help educators.<P>

George McCrary, workforce development manager at Wal-Mart Stores, said his company has a policy that every store must adopt a school and work as partners with educators. He urged the educators in the room to go back home and contact their local Wal-Mart store manager to set up a program with their schools.<P>

Karl Chapman, founder and chief executive of Spring Group PLC, said in England the government made improving schools and workers' skills a priority. Teacher training, the ability to close poor schools and the creation of ""learning accounts"" that allow people to take out loans during their lifetimes to retrain are just a few of the things that country is doing.<P>

99,otherevent_99,Financing our Global Environmental Future,NULL,Forums,"The world spends billions of dollars each year to protect the environment. But despite these efforts, ecosystems continue to be lost in record numbers.
<P>
In an effort to stem these losses, the Milken Institute, United Nations Foundation and 
The Nature Conservancy have embarked on a unique partnership to work on finding solutions to environmental problems using financial innovations.
<P>
On March 22, 2001, the three organizations co-sponsored a one-day conference in Beverly Hills, CA, &quot;Financing Our Global Environmental Future,&quot; which focused on how to use financial markets to save the world&prime;s rain forests, coral reefs and other ecosystems.
<P>
The conference brought together more than 75 business, financial and environmental leaders in a series of panel discussions, speeches and breakout sessions that explored everything from carbon credits markets to equity funds for environmentally sensitive companies.
<P>
The attendees offered an optimistic, albeit tempered, view of the possibilities of using finance to benefit nature.
<P>
&quot;We have no choice but to protect the planet,&quot; said Institute Chairman Michael Milken. The question is, &quot;How do we pay for it? Those who find the solution will reap the financial rewards.&quot;
<P>
Timothy E. Wirth, President of the UN Foundation and a former U.S. senator from Colorado, said a lot of progress has been made in saving the world&prime;s ecosystems. But that progress has not kept up with the ongoing destruction of the world&prime;s bio assets. 
<P>
&quot;We&prime;re never going to get there unless we figure out how to bring financial technologies to bear on these problems,&quot; he said.
<P>
The Milken Institute is an expert in using financial innovations to help solve public policy problems. Coupled with the UN Foundation&prime;s global reach and The Nature Conservancy&prime;s strong environmental credentials, the three organizations offer a strong partnership in finding new ways to save environmentally sensitive areas through financial incentives.
<P>
Throughout the day, attendees pointed to many of the successes they&prime;ve had, such as eco-tourism, environmentally friendly equity funds and &quot;green&quot; products that don&prime;t hurt nature.
<P>
But the biggest problem, they said, is figuring out how to pay for the effort. Although some have pegged the worth of the earth&prime;s biosphere at $33 trillion, only a tiny fraction of that is spent trying to save it.
<P>
Figuring out a price for the world&prime;s ecosystems &#151; and then coming up with ways to make money that can be used to save them &#151; is &quot;the holy grail&quot; of this effort, said Ricardo Bayon, a fellow at the New America Foundation. 
<P>
&quot;We&prime;re still early in our understanding of what these forests provide,&quot; said Michael Jenkins, executive director of Forest Trends, &quot;so it&prime;s hard to create markets for them.&quot;
<P>
Added Stanford University biologist Gretchen Daily: &quot;What&prime;s the value to society to invest in a piece of the coast?&quot;
<P>
In addition, some of the world&prime;s most valuable ecosystems are government property, or in such countries as Cambodia or Myanmar, where investors won&prime;t go.
<P>
On the more optimistic side, Michael Walsh, senior vice president of Environmental Financial Products, said initiatives such as carbon credits markets &#151; where a &quot;clean&quot; company can sell its emission allotment to others, while overall pollution limits are lowered &#151; show that the idea of using financial markets to save the environment can work.
<P>
&quot;We are really turning some corners here,&quot; he said.
<P>
The three organizations plan further meetings to continue the dialogue and create concrete proposals to help solve environmental problems using financial tools.

Milken Institute and Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs
<P>
On September 19, 2000, the Jerusalem Center and the Milken Institute sponsored a closed forum for experts on capital market reform. 
<P>
As a prerequisite for privatization, it is necessary to reform the capital market to enable the raising of funds from the public or investment companies to privatize government-owned companies or services.

The proceedings of the conference were published in Hebrew for an Israeli audience in the volume <a href=""/publications/publications.taf?function=detail&ID=73&cat=Books"">Practical Privatization: Lessons from Cities and Markets,</a> which outlines how outsourcing and privatization can be used by Israel's local authorities to improve their ability to deliver quality services to their residents at lower cost. The conference examined the U.S. experience with privatization in various cities in light of the ongoing effort in Israel to decrease public-sector involvement in its cities.
<P>
Among the speakers were Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Israeli Finance Minister Ya'akov Ne'eman, Indianapolis Mayor Stephen Goldsmith, and representatives of the finance and investment sectors. More than 200 people attended, including representatives from most of Israel's major cities, as well as scholars, government economic officials and business leaders.

106,otherevent_106,"Shimon Peres, Nobel Laureate, former Prime Minister of Israel",NULL,Forums,"The war against terrorists is unlike any war in history, and defeating them requires a much different strategy than ever before &#151; one that involves technology, economics and law as well as military might, said Shimon Peres, Nobel Laureate and former Prime Minister of Israel. <P>

Speaking to a group of 70 Los Angeles business leaders in a special forum held for members of the Milken Institute Associates, Peres outlined four major events that must be addressed in the coming decade to avert global disaster: confrontation with terrorists, resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, environmental decline and the development of nanotechnology.<P>

Today's primary danger is confrontation with terrorists, said Peres. Terrorism requires cooperation, and without exception, the countries that harbor terrorists are dictatorships that lack transparency, courts of law and equal rights for women. What is the best weapon for fighting terrorism? Peres' answer: technology. As proof that technology forces nations to change, Peres pointed to China. Nothing, he said, could have changed the communist nature of China but technology. Terrorist-friendly countries lack technology because that type of investment requires an environment of values, transparency and openness. The war against terror is a ""nonclassical war,"" Peres said, without frontiers. No one, he asserted &#151; Chinese, Russian, Israeli or American &#151; can live in a world in which it is a danger to fly in a plane, drink the water or breathe the air. <P>
 
Another element of the dangers that face the world today is the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. ""There is a new theater of war &#151; the Middle East,"" Peres said. To diffuse this requires a resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The good news, he pointed out, is that the solution is clear, and there is sufficient support among the Palestinian people, the United States and most of Europe to make it happen: replace Arafat &#151; a dictator &#151; with a legitimate government of legitimate ministers, a real government structure and a transparent economy. Why hasn't there been a single suicide bomber from Jordan, whose population is more than 80 percent Palestinian, Peres asked. Because Jordan has a legitimately elected government, its citizens do not feel oppressed. Peres said this change must occur as early as 2005 to avoid a greater regional war.<P>

The third major event the world must address in the next decade is the environmental problem, one that Peres described as a social and political one. As long as poor countries are forced to strip their lands of natural resources to put food in their stomachs, severe and irreparable climate alterations will continue. By destroying the balance of nature, he said, we are inviting disaster. Rich countries must come to terms with poor countries to stabilize the environment.<P>

The final major event that Peres considers so significant that he views it as ""a new dimension"" is the development of nanotechnology &#151; the art of manipulating materials on an atomic or molecular scale. All other technology pales in comparison, he stated. Peres urged governments to use this technology, and atomic energy, constructively. <P>

The confrontation against terror, Peres concluded, is not a Jewish-Moslem problem. It is a conflict of freedom versus oppression. Countries that lack freedom sow terror. The democratization of these nations is terrorism's greatest threat. Technology and the media are instrumental in making this change come about because they bring the free world into these same countries. <P>

""I am accused in my country of being an optimist,"" he said. ""But I have never met a pessimist who discovered a star&hellip;. Or built a factory."" <P>

Bratton, the former police commissioner of Boston and New York City who was appointed LAPD chief in October 2002 by Mayor James Hahn, conceded that changing such a large bureaucracy is not easy, especially in a city as diverse and complex as Los Angeles.

Secretariat, the former Soviet Union and the E.U.<p>

Gold began by outlining three elements that formed the basis for the current effort: <br><li>
Unequivocal evidence of the link between the Palestinian Authority and terrorism, calling for new leadership. <br><li>
An immediate, unarmed cease fire ending terror against Israeli civilians before the start of negotiations. <br><li>
The ultimate establishment of a Palestinian state.</li><p>

Commenting on the PA's ""new"" leadership, he pointed out that of the 25 members of the Palestinian Parliament, only four are loyal to Abu Mazzen, the Palestinian Authority's recently appointed Prime Minister while 21 remain loyal to Arafat. Abu Mazzen controls one security service, while Arafat remains in command of eight security services.<p> Gold also noted that while there is a clear consensus among Palestinians about the meaning of ""peace,"" that being a Palestinian state, Israelis have been less articulate about their understanding beyond a ""safe"" peace. Gold stressed the importance of articulating clear concrete goals in Israel's negotiations and suggested three: one undivided Jerusalem with Israel as sovereign, secure, defensible borders, no ""right of return"" for Palestinians with immediate disbandment of refugee camps and absorption of those Palestinians into the countries in which they reside.<p>

Another important issue that Gold focused on in his discussion was that Israel had, in fact, complied with U.N. Resolution 242 in 2000 when it ended its military occupation and withdrew its forces, placing the Palestinian Authority in charge of 98% of West Bank and the Gaza Strip.<p>

Other topics discussed by Gold:<br><li>
A halt to support of terrorist groups by Arab states, specifically noting Saudi Arabia's assistance to Hamas and its importance to improving the security of the U.S.;<br><li>
Investment in Palestinian infrastructure by Egypt and Jordan;<br><li>
An end to incitement, which he described as ""motivation for terror,"" calling it the first step in moving toward peace and ""an essential issue to resolve.""</li><p>

But to ease immigrants' absorption into their new country, and maximize the benefits earlier on, government must change its policies to reflect regional needs, as well as clarify immigrants' rights and responsibilities, participants agreed.<P>

In a unique gathering of more than 100 scholars and businesspeople from the Latino and Israeli communities, the conference &#151; hosted by the Milken Institute, in conjunction with the Consulate General of Israel, The Tomás Rivera Policy Institute and the Jewish Federation Community Relations Committee &#151; examined the economic, political, cultural and demographic effects of immigration on California and Israel, and the common challenges they pose.<P>

Following opening remarks by Los Angeles Councilman Joel Weiss and Los Angeles City Attorney Rocky Delgadillo, attendees attended four panel sessions:<P> 

<b>The Politics of Absorption: Immigration and our Political Sphere</b> compared the influence of politics and voting rights on immigrants' acclimation to their new homes.  In the early American and Israeli experiences, political parties organized immigrant groups, providing them with basic services such as health care, housing, jobs and education. As a result, immigrants often joined the political party that shepherded them in their early days. In the U.S., however, the right to vote that comes with naturalization takes a minimum of five years, enough time for loyalties to subside or for indifference to set in, diluting their influence. In Israel, the right to vote is immediate, but that carries its own risks, such as whether the Israeli political scene is unduly influenced by people from other countries not yet socialized to Israel's way of life.<P> 

<b>The Mechanism of Absorption: The Role of Government</b> focused on the benefits that come with integration &#151; economic stimulation, civic participation, public safety - and policies that can help accelerate newcomers' entry into the community. Panelists noted that government policies and societal needs were often in conflict (e.g. exclusion from job training vs. the labor needs of the region), and that they needed to be brought in alignment. The state can help promote democracy by helping immigrants fulfill their responsibilities - to work, speak the language, pay taxes and participate in civic responsibilities. Panelists added, however, that jobs, not policy, draw people to a particular region.<P>

<b>Melting Pot or Mosaic? Identity and Immigration</b> addressed the impact of global immigration on society over generations. Panelists agreed that the same model did not apply to European and Latino immigrants. These groups had very different immigration and absorption experiences, ultimately creating a ""salad bowl"" of people combining their American and ancestral identities. While ""the most successful immigrants disappeared into the landscape,"" noted Moctesuma Esparza, many second- and third-generation Americans turn around to reclaim their history and create an entirely new identity.<P>  

<b>The Bottom Line: Economic Benefits and Costs of Immigration<b/> Immigration has a positive net effect on the economy as immigrants buy homes and businesses, panelists said. In the U.S. and in Israel, homeownership is seen as perhaps the most significant aspect in integrating immigrants into their communities and society. Access to capital gives immigrants a stake in the community. Homeownership, always widespread among immigrants in Israeli, where special mortgages are available to newcomers, is expanding among Latinos in the United States as well. New immigrants also bring with them new knowledge and skills. When there is a common vision, these elements converge to create a strong society, panelists said.<P>

Closing Plenary Speakers compared and contrasted the Israeli and Latino experiences. They offered lessons from the past and ideas for improving those experiences, both for immigrants and the community at large. Education and inclusion in the political process were cited as focal points for making the immigration process a successful one for all parties.

110,otherevent_110,Saving Capitalism from the Capitalists,NULL,Forums,"While cautioning that good government is an essential part of a successful capitalistic system, Raghuram Rajan defended globalization, open trade and free markets as the best way to eliminate poverty.<p>

Addressing some 200 people at a Milken Institute Forum, Rajan summed up the concepts laid out in his book, <i>Saving Capitalism from the Capitalists: Unleashing the Power of Financial Markets to Create Wealth and Spread Opportunity</i>. He began with the three key points that he and his co-author, Luigi Zingales, make in their book:<p>
 
(1)	Markets give the poor the promise of mobility. Truly free markets, Rajan said, ""are the single most important tools to eliminate poverty and spread opportunity.""<br>
(2)	Markets need good government. When there is too little of the right kind of government, he asserted, markets work poorly, adding that the force of globalization is making governments more market-friendly.<br>
(3)	Markets are fragile and even free-market societies should not be complacent. The best protection for fragile markets, Rajan said, is awareness of what can go wrong. Raising that awareness was the goal that he and his co-author hoped to accomplish in writing their book.<p>
 
Citing an example of what could go wrong in capitalism, Rajan claimed that what many decry as capitalism's exploitation of the poor is in fact a failure of capitalism because the poor do not have access to cheap financing. Access to financing, he stated, enables the realization of dreams.<p>

Why are countries poor? Because they lack the underlying infrastructure &#151; good accounting, corporate governance, etc. &#151; that make financial systems work.  Why, then, don't they have functioning systems? Rajan said the perception of those in power is that improving the system will not serve them, thus they do not have the incentives to push for better infrastructure. Having risen to power under a particular system, incumbent capitalists block improvements because freer access to finance and competition would unseat many of them while fostering the widespread prosperity they espouse. <p>

Well-functioning capitalism requires a ""Goldilocks government,"" that is, something in the middle, Rajan said. The capitalist system needs both a well-developed government infrastructure and a business environment that promotes competition. How do you get governments to work for the common good and expand capital markets? By making those in power see that it's in their interest to become more pro-market rather than to block their development.<p>

Rajan believes that this is happening ""quietly"" through globalization. He gave the example of India's post-revolution government, which at the time controlled all production in the country. Shielded from competition, there was no incentive to change, or improve. The quality of goods produced by India's manufacturing sector was abysmal. In the 1990s, following the example of China, India allowed foreign manufacturers into the country and the quality of production among Indian companies markedly improved. This, he said, has led to the elite pushing reform in favor of the common good. Awake now to the high quality of goods available in the marketplace, a consumer revolution is taking place in India, being financed by what Rajan described as a ""creaky"" financial system that must be improved.<p>

On the issue of outsourcing, Rajan explained that in the long run, foreign outsourcing benefits both countries. Citing the example of U.S. efforts to block the outsourcing of steel production, he observed that it protected a few jobs short term but raised the price of American automobiles, hurting that industry and sending consumers to foreign-made cars. Ultimately, he said, there is no partial protection. Stopping outsourcing decreases the level of entrepreneurship, closes a country's doors and closes its economy. This happened here in the 1930s, and he warned that it could happen again.<p>

""Multinationals do improve lives in other countries,"" he said. While today there may be inequality in pay scales and employee protection, eventually there will be a convergence of standards. Through globalization, competition will hit areas previously untouched. More free trade will lead to greater growth and increased well-being.<p>

117,otherevent_117,Making Schools Work,NULL,Forums,"There is a lot of talk about school reform these days. Some focus on pay. Others look at classroom size. Still others want to increase teacher and principal accountability.<p>

William Ouchi, a professor of management at UCLA's Anderson School, takes a more business-like approach to the problem. In a landmark study outlined in his new book, <i>Making Schools Work</i>, Ouchi found that the biggest obstacles to improving education are large, centralized school bureaucracies.<p>

In an examination of 223 schools in six cities &#151; from the massive Los Angeles Unified School District to much smaller Catholic archdiocesan schools &#151; Ouchi found that the schools whose students performed best had the most decentralized management systems. In these schools, the principals &#151; not central office administrators &#151; controlled school budgets and personnel.<p> 

Does it work?<p>

Ouchi pointed to three innovative school systems he examined in Edmonton (Canada), Seattle and Houston. These systems were once plagued by the same problems that trouble Los Angeles, New York and other big-city school districts: poor test scores, flight to private schools and high dropout rates.<p>

But leaders in each city changed their systems, moving control from a centralized office to individual schools. Principals were allowed to put money where they thought it would do the most good.  In essence, they were allowed to act as entrepreneurs and make decisions based on their school's unique circumstances.<p>

The changes have produced significant, lasting improvements in these districts, Ouchi said. In Edmonton, for example, where school principals now control 91 percent of their budgets (compared to 6.7 percent for Los Angeles school principals), test scores are up and parents, teachers and students are all much happier with their schools.<p>

""They have put private schools out of business,"" Ouchi said. ""That, to me, is the acid test.""<p>

In Seattle, 43 percent of children were in private schools in 1970. Today, that is down to 35 percent. In Houston, whose students consistently outscore those of Los Angeles by nearly 10 points in both reading and math, test scores are way up.<p>

The key, Ouchi said, is what he calls the Weighted Student Formula, whereby every student is evaluated and assessed a certain dollar value in educational services. If a school has more nonEnglish-speaking students, for example, the principal can put more money into classes that help them learn English. Or it could go to hire tutors to teach at-risk students. The bottom line, he added, is money is put to its best use for each school.<p>

""Every group of children is different,"" Ouchi said.<p> 

He said he has worked to help reform the Los Angeles Unified School District, whose students typically score near the bottom of national tests, but without success. He called LAUSD ""the most centralized education system in the country, other than Hawaii."" (Los Angeles spends only 35.4 percent of its budget on teacher pay, while Houston spends 48.5 percent and Edmonton spends 55.8 percent on teachers.)<p>

But, he argues, if reform can work in places like Houston and Seattle, it can work in Los Angeles.<p>

119,otherevent_119,The 2% Solution: Fixing America's Problems in Ways Liberals and Conservatives Can Love,NULL,Forums,"America's most serious problems &#151; such as the 40 million people without health insurance or the poor state of education in our urban schools &#151; remain unsolved thanks to a lack of imagination, will and ability by both sides to compromise. Only some new thinking, new approaches and a willingness by leaders from both political parties to listen to each other's views can change things, said Matt Miller. <P>

Miller, a syndicated columnist and radio commentator, thinks he has just the answer to end the stalemate &#151; the ""2% Solution."" <P>

As described in his new book by the same name, Miller's thesis is that for just two cents on the dollar, all Americans could have health insurance, full-time workers could earn a decent living wage, and children in the inner-city can have the best teachers. We can do all of this, he said, using conservative means &#151; like tax subsidies and vouchers &#151; to achieve liberal goals. And in the end, government would still be smaller than it was when Ronald Reagan was president.<P>

Sound too good to be true? Miller doesn't think so. <P>

""With the baby boomers retiring, we no longer have the luxury of not being serious about these issues,"" he told a Milken Institute Forum audience. ""At the end of the day, what I'm talking about is tiny compared to other things we've done in our history."" <P>

What he proposes, Miller said, is spending no more money as a percentage of the country's GDP than what the government spent during Reagan's term &#151; about 22 percent. In 2004, that's about $220 billion, or ""2 percent"" of our $11 trillion national income. <P>

Tired of seeing little progress on a host of important policy issues, Miller spent the past couple of years talking with thought leaders from both sides of the aisle &#151; from political strategist James Carville to Nobel laureate Milton Friedman &#151; before coming up with solutions that he feels both sides could agree on.<P>

Each side, however, must be willing to compromise &#151; the ""grand bargain,"" as he calls it. The left has to be more open to market-based solutions, and the right has to be more open to spending money commensurate with the size of the problem.<P>

""We cannot solve these problems without money,"" Miller said. ""And we have the money."" <P>

Miller said he hopes his book will change national politics by showing Americans how we can reframe the debate and fix some of the nation's biggest domestic problems through solutions that are pragmatic, broadly acceptable and just.<P>

If we don't do it soon, he warned, our ability to fix these problems will become almost impossible. Less than 10 years remain before the baby boomer's retirement will start to drain away all the cash and political energy to do anything but cope with their colossal health and pension costs.<P>

But it was a politician &#151; albeit a Nobel laureate and one of the world's most honored &#151; who put the day's discussion in perspective.<P>

Former Prime Minister Shimon Peres of Israel said the planet's two most important resources &#151; fresh air and clean water &#151; receive the least attention of the world's leaders. With the global population explosion, land has become a limited resource, Peres said, and we must subsidize efforts in science and technology that will help solve the problems that this growth has created.<P> 

It is science and technology that enrich us, he said, and we must help those making advances in using new energy sources &#151; the sun, wind, and nuclear energy &#151; to provide clean, low-cost ways of generating power.<P>

Peres lauded efforts by technology companies to combat pollution, desalinate water and develop clean energy sources in nondestructive ways. In Africa, for example, a project is underway that combines the heat of the desert with the power of its waterfalls to supply energy to Europe. Investing in knowledge, especially in nanotechnology, Peres said, is the future.<P>
 
The day-long event, spearheaded by the Government of Israel Economic Mission and hosted by the Milken Institute, featured panel discussions with leaders in water and energy technology from California and Israel. Each panel discussion was followed by technology company presentations highlighting specific developments in the areas of water and energy. Emphasis was placed on efforts to substantially expand the use of alternative energy sources and create more efficient methods of water usage.<P> 

Several new products were introduced this year by presenters, including a device that purifies salt and non-potable water using solar energy, one that utilizes magnetic technology to clean industrial wastewater, and several others that offer environmentally friendly, efficient and cost-effective methods for removing pollution. 
Luncheon keynote speaker David Freeman, Chairman of the California Consumer Power and Conservation Financing Authority, advocated a transition to renewable hydrogen in place of fuel to power trucks, buses, cars and even airplanes.<P>

We do not need to wait for the fuel cell, Freeman said. The technology is here, but the will is lacking. It takes enlightened citizens and leadership to reduce our dependence on Middle East oil, he stressed, which he characterized as dangerous to America and among the largest problems we face.<P>

Because the United States, Europe and Japan have aging populations, the ratio of workers per retiree is dwindling, he said. By 2050, that ratio is expected to be 2.6:1 in the U.S., and as low as 1:1 in Italy. Those are unsustainable ratios.<P>

""Who will produce the goods?"" Siegel asked. ""Who will buy the assets?""<P>

Either today's workers will have to delay retirement into their 70s &#151; something not many Americans would relish &#151; or other nations will have to take up the slack. Productivity gains and immigration won't be enough.<P>

The only other answer, Siegel said, is that developing countries &#151; which today have 80 percent of the world's population, but produce only 20 percent of its GDP &#151; will have to make up the difference. If these younger nations can grow their GDP 6 percent annually, they will produce the world's goods and buy its assets.<P>

""The economic power will shift to them,"" Siegel said. ""By 2050, they'll own more than 80 percent of the world's capital.""<P>

This has huge implications for investors and companies, he added, among them the explosion of growth and demand in emerging domestic markets.<P>

During his talk, co-hosted by the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, Siegel, author of <I>Stocks for the Long Run</I>, also discussed his belief that stocks will continue to outperform other asset classes, as they have over history.<P>

He included historical charts showing that the average returns for stocks, minus inflation, has been 6.7 percent for more than 100 years, while bonds' average return has been 3.5 percent. In addition, while stocks are riskier over the short-term, his research shows that over any 30-year period, stocks are actually safer than bonds.<P>

He also discussed his ""core investing"" principles, such as that companies should focus on their core competencies. To show that these principles work, he produced a list of the best-performing stocks since 1950. At the top was National Dairy Products Corp. (now Kraft Foods), which has brought investors 15 percent annual returns, followed by R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, Standard Oil of New Jersey (now ExxonMobil) and Coca Cola &#151; all companies that focus on what they do best.<P>

One of the reasons investors have done well by these firms, he said, is they give out dividends &#151; an important and sometimes overlooked strategy for building wealth. The recent trend by companies to give out stock options to their executives has led CEOs to focus on driving up stock prices. That, in turn, has led to reduced dividends from about 5 percent for most of the 20th century to about 1 percent during the bull market of the 1990s and only slightly more than that today. Siegel said dividends are not only a good investment tool, but they increase investor confidence in the market. <P>

And there are the ongoing analyses of pending policy issues such as trade and financial market regulation. <P>

""All of these discussions take place within the context of the budget outlook for the U.S.,"" Holtz-Eakin said.<P>


For the current fiscal year, the deficit is expected to reach $480 billion. Next year, it is projected to be $350 billion. Deficits will continue to decline until about 2012, when a balanced budget is finally reached. In 2013, we should finally see a surplus again, he said.<P>


But, he emphasized, these projections are based on current laws &#151; some of which undoubtedly will change. Policy, he said, is the big uncertainty in trying to figure out where the federal budget is headed. <P>

A proponent of the ""broken windows"" philosophy of policing, Bratton cited L.A.'s small police force as the greatest impediment to solving some of its toughest crime problems &#151; especially gang violence. Because of the relatively small number of police officers, the force must make incremental, rather than a dynamic changes in addressing the city's crime problems, he said.<p>

The ""broken windows"" philosophy calls for improving quality-of-life issues to rid an area of petty crime and destructive behavior that lead to greater, more serious offenses. Combined with other important crime-fighting techniques such as community policing, this method has been highly successful in dramatically reducing crime in cities such as Boston and New York. While progress has been made in attacking problems specifically identified by L.A.'s citizens, such as graffiti, its gang problem will only be resolved, the chief stated, with more police, more after-school programs and more jobs.<p>

Bratton's talk was followed by a panel discussion with four leading proponents of his crime-fighting philosophy.<p>

Criminologist and economist James Wilson characterized the police force as only one component of successful crime fighting. ""Police make a difference,"" he said, ""but they need help from other government agencies,"" whose behavior affects the ability to sustain the outcome of policing efforts. City government, he maintained, ought to focus on the problems neighborhoods identify &#151; empty buildings used for dealing drugs, abandoned cars, litter and other conditions that cause neighborhoods to deteriorate &#151; and remove those conditions. These efforts improve public order, public confidence and reduce crime.<p>

George Kelling, a professor in Rutgers University's School of Criminal Justice, emphasized that the solutions present themselves when the problem is correctly identified. Blighted areas, such as L.A.'s Skid Row, are characterized by a culture of lawlessness, he said. When the local culture condones an atmosphere where ""anything goes,"" its residents suffer. They live in fear and are terrorized by local gangs and petty criminals. By paying attention to quality-of-life issues &#151; that is, stopping people who create havoc &#151; the police can help restore order and safety in crime-ridden neighborhoods, he said.<p>

The Rev. Eugene Rivers, co-chair of the National Ten Point Leadership Foundation, emphasized the importance of building strategic partnerships with other government agencies, local communities, faith-based organizations and even private companies. To resolve L.A.'s culture of violence and gang problem, the city must engage the community to face the problem and create disincentives to crime. The work of society, he concluded, must complement the efforts of the police department.<p>

Peter Cove, founder of America Works, said putting parolees to work as soon as they leave prison would reduce recidivism. Of the 600,000 people who leave state penitentiaries each year alone, he said, 70 percent are back in three years. Having found that quickly moving people into work from welfare made a difference in the welfare roles, he decided to apply that model to ex-convicts. Cove observed that those individuals who were moved into work almost immediately after leaving prison didn't go back. Though the program is too new to measure results, the indications are that prison-to-work programs would have a major impact on lowering crime.<p>

Laying out themes from their book, <i>Beyond Junk Bonds</i>, Yago and Trimbath told the Forum audience that innovations in finance have greatly improved the sources and availability of capital in the U.S. in recent decades, which has helped fuel America's tremendous economic growth. As similar innovations become more widely available, they can also help other countries &#151; something that is starting to happen, they said. <P>

""The story of financing the future is the story of financing change,"" said Yago. <P>

Access to capital makes it possible for companies to improve productivity &#151; for example, by allowing them to restructure in times of competitive change or difficulty, or to merge with other firms to save costs. <P>

New financial technologies and tools give capital markets the flexibility they need to respond to competitive circumstances, they said. These include such ideas as securitized mortgages and credit cards, collateralized loan obligations, and derivatives. <P>

Yago and Trimbath also gave a history of the high-yield bond market, including its performance versus equities and other investments over the past decade. High-yield securities have become well-established financial tools used by today's biggest global companies. <P>

At the heart of their talk, however, was the idea that such innovations, and the free flow of capital, is crucial to solving some of our most important public policy issues, from paying for the retirement of millions of baby boomers to saving global ecosystems.  Also, with the debate over globalization and how developing countries are going to raise their standards of living, these financial innovations can play an important role, they said. <P>

But most important, they must focus on the area's most important asset &#151; its people &#151; and that means  improving education and helping create well-paying jobs. <p>

That was the message from four of Los Angeles' leading public officials at a California State Forum hosted by the Milken Institute: ""California's Economic Recovery: Financing Our Infrastructure."" <p>
The panelists were Roy Romer, Superintendent of the L.A. Unified School District; Michael D. Antonovich, Los Angeles County Supervisor; Laura Chick, Los Angeles City Controller; and Eric Garcetti, Los Angeles City Councilman.<p>

Garcetti focused on what he called ""a crisis of finance"" within state and local governments, as well as the critical need for housing, while Chick decried a ""crisis of confidence"" that people have because of the appearance of an un-level playing field in the bidding for some of the city's contracts.<p>

Antonovich cited a litany of issues that need addressing, from traffic to education, but left his most pointed criticisms for Sacramento, where the state Legislature has been on what he called a spending ""binge"" for several years.<p>

Romer emphasized the good things that are happening at the school district, such as rising scores in elementary grades and the recent voter approval of bond Measure R, which allows the district to continue with much-needed school construction.<p>

The meeting included follow-up questions from a panel of experts: Ross DeVol, Director of Regional Economics at the Milken Institute; Howard Fine, a reporter for the <I>Los Angeles Business Journal</I>; and George Kieffer, Chairman of the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce.

The ambassador added, however, that he is sorry to see the rift between the U.S. and its longtime allies France and Germany over the war, since it's important that the Trans-Atlantic relationship remain strong. <p>
While Hungary has supported the U.S. decision on Iraq, it has also worked hard to maintain its good relationship with Germany, its key partner in Europe. <p>

Ambassador Simonyi touched on a variety of other issues, including immigration, demographics, investments in Hungary and the economy.<p>

134,Sandor_Roundtable,Market-Based Solutions through Environmental Finance: the Case of the Chicago Climate Exchange,NULL,finLabs,"Back when he came up with the idea of creating a public exchange that would trade the rights to carbon dioxide, many on both sides of the equation &#151; the financial community and environmentalists &#151; thought his chances of success were, well, small. <p>

After all, the markets were down and the U.S. had pulled out of the Kyoto Protocol, which could have helped jumpstart the initiative.<p>

But Richard Sandor, who created the idea of trading financial futures in the 1970s, knew it could work. And in December 2003, through perseverance and perhaps a little luck, he saw his dream come true in the form of the Chicago Climate Exchange, a self-regulatory exchange that administers a voluntary greenhouse gas reduction and trading program for North America.<p>

At a Milken Institute roundtable meeting with government officials, environmental organizations and members of the financial community, Sandor said the Exchange has been wildly successful in its first two months.<p>

Already on board as members are such firms as Ford, DuPont, IBM, Motorola and American Electric Power, as well as the city of Chicago and the University of Oklahoma. And the trading of carbon dioxide has nearly tripled since the Exchange opened on Dec. 12.<p>

""This is going to dominate the environmental forefront,"" Sandor said of the idea of cap-and-trade programs. It could even expand into the areas of trading the rights to air and water.<p>

""They are our most important commodities, and they have to be rationed,"" he said. He added that markets are the best way to do that &#151; much better than armies fighting over it.<p>

The meeting was part of the Milken Institute's ongoing series of presentations of financial innovations addressing long-standing public policy problems bringing together financial practitioners, policy makers and change agents in the public and private sector.<p>

Dr. Sandor, Chairman and CEO of the Chicago Climate Exchange, was the recipient of the Milken Institute's 2003 Award for Financial Innovation and the subject of recent in-depth reports in Time and Forbes magazines. He is a director on numerous boards, including the Intercontinental Exchange, an electronic marketplace for commodity and derivative products, and is a member of the design committee of the Dow Jones Sustainability Index. <p>

In Santa Barbara County, the average price of a home is $930,000, yet teachers in the area only make between $30,000 and $40,000 year &#151; not nearly enough to afford a place of their own. So where do these teachers, as well as the firefighters, police officers and other workers crucial to a community, live? <p>

It's a problem facing workers not only in Santa Barbara, but nationwide &#151; especially in California where home prices continue to climb as demand outstrips supply.<p>

It's also a problem that the speakers at this Forum are tackling head-on as they implement creative and workable solutions to the lack of affordable housing for workers.<p>

Mike Curzan of UniDev LLC, whose principals have developed and are developing over $400 million of affordable workforce housing in markets around the U.S., says his goal is simple: ""We want to create as low a price as possible &#151; within reason of construction costs &#151; to make it affordable to people.""<p>

His firm's most recent project is at California State University at Channel Islands, which already consists of over 250 for-sale homes and rental apartments designed to serve a mixed-income population. Residents with incomes as low as $40,000 can purchase units being developed with prices as low as $165,000. Eventually, it will have 900 units of affordable faculty and staff housing, a small amount of commercial and R&D space &#151; and over $800 million in revenue for the campus.<p>

The key to UniDev's success is land. The sponsor &#151; in this case, CSU &#151; commits land to the project and UniDev takes care of the rest. Through the use of a ground lease, the sponsor is able to control the project, giving priority for housing to certain employees (professors, for example, or nurses) and receive revenue in the process.<p>

The idea is to create quality housing for workers who couldn't ordinarily afford it, allowing them to live in the community where they work. This reduces commute time and allows hospitals, cities or universities to attract employees without having to raise salaries to beyond what they can afford.<p>

Marc Wright of Martinez & Wright Homeownership Partners discussed his group's housing benefit program that enables essential workers in expensive California markets to buy homes near their workplace. They contract with employers to provide a housing subsidy, while receiving a share of equity proportional to Partners' contribution toward the property's purchase price.<p>

""The employee only pays what they can afford,"" he said. ""We fill in the gap.""<p>

Ted Chandler of Fannie Mae discussed his organization's support for these innovative solutions. He also cited Fannie Mae's commitment to affordable housing. One example is the American Dream Commitment program, which was created to provide $2 trillion in private capital for 18 million minority and underserved Americans to own or rent a home by the end of the decade.<p>

Suzanne Reade, President of Urban Insurance Partners Institute, which provides insurers with the resources, contacts and data needed to write business effectively in urban areas, discussed the challenges and opportunities insurers see in the urban marketplace. <p>

""They have to rethink the way they do business,"" she said of insurance companies.<p>

The Forum was part of a day of meetings and presentations at the Milken Institute co-hosted by Fannie Mae that brought together city and county officials, real estate and mortgage insurance executives, and other housing and financing lenders to provide them with information on resources that are available about the housing crisis, the status of housing affordability and its effects in communities.",,,,,,,,,,3,25,2004,NULL,NULL,0,,"Milken Institute Conference Center<br>

He said the addition of 10 new member countries in May will strengthen the EU because they will bring new voices, new ideas and strong ideals to the organization.<p>

""They aren't going to be shoved around by anybody,"" Cox said. ""Europe will be richer with them.""<p>

With his visit coming just days after voters ousted Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar's Popular Party from power on the heels of terrorist bombings in Madrid, Cox focused many of his comments on that issue.<p>

He reassured his audience that the change in Spain's government will not cause a shift in the global effort to fight terrorism.
<p>
""I don't believe any Spanish administration is going to go soft on terrorism,"" he said. ""I expect them to have a very, very strong anti-terrorism policy.""<p>

During his talk and a question-and-answer session that followed, Cox touched on a host of issues facing Europe, including its relations with the U.S., intellectual property concerns, the Microsoft anti-trust dispute, trade, job creation and immigration.<p>

A member of the European Parliament since 1989, Cox represents the constituency of Munster in the Republic of Ireland. Before entering politics, he worked both as an economics lecturer and as a journalist and television presenter on Irish television. Having been elected to the European Parliament as a Progressive Democrat MEP in 1989, he was successfully re-elected, this time as an Independent Member, in 1994. He was elected president of the European Parliament in 2002.

138,forum_right_nation_0604,The Right Nation: Conservative Power in America,NULL,Forums,"<i>The Right Nation: Conservative Power in America</i> is a portrait of the genesis and rise of America's conservative movement, said co-author John Micklethwait. The portrait captures the groups, initiatives, think tanks and ideologies that epitomize the America's conservative right, a movement unparalleled in any other part of the world. Conservatives, he pointed out, are members of rifle clubs, love NASCAR, hate government, live in the South and suburbs of the heartland, and are fiercely moralistic. With 41 percent of Americans identifying themselves as conservatives, the country's center of gravity is much more to the right than other developed nations. This, Micklethwait said, explains the gulf between America and its allies, as well as their hatred of President George W. Bush.<p> 

While the American left has equivalent movements overseas, there is no equivalent of the American right in Europe. Its ideology seems ""un-American."" While liberals oppose racial inequality, support restrictions on guns, oppose the death penalty and are anti-abortion, the South, West and American heartland are bound by strident nationalism, profound differences in values, fervent opposition to government say on almost every issue, and overwhelming support for high defense spending.<p>
""America,"" Micklethwait stated, ""is clearly divided along ideological lines."" The left-right political division is based more on culture and values and less on class. Rich or poor, conservatives go to church at least once a week, believe the role of government is to provide freedom to pursue personal goals, support a strong military and are very patriotic. This too, he noted, has no counterpart in other developed countries, where government is expected to guarantee that no one is left in need, church attendance is sporadic and support for taxation for public services is high.<p> 

The six features of American conservatism, according to the Micklethwait, who wrote the book with Adrian Wooldridge, the <i>Economist</i>'s Washington-based correspondent, are religion, government, capitalism, the complete absence of socialism, tradition and geography. Conservatives are more religious, skeptical of government, advocate decentralization, focus on progress&mdash;capitalism's main product&mdash;and have no legacy of social welfare. Unlike overcrowded Europe, the vast American continent has enough space to provide each person with an acre of land, not including Alaska, and still only occupy 1/20th of the country. This fact, the authors maintain, has nurtured the frontier spirit and aversion to government intrusion.<p>

Thanks to immigration and a higher birth rate, America's population is aging much more slowly than Europe's, and its conservative movement is growing. America, the authors predict, will have increasing economic strength (notwithstanding the baby-boomer liabilities being handed down to future generations) and will become the world's police, given the conservative penchant for increasing military strength.<p> 

Micklethwait noted that while America's left has ""vast intellectual power, more money and more brains"" than the conservatives, they ""lack the organization"" that has been the underpinning of the conservative movement's success. Conservatives remain united and are able to proceed even when not in office whereas the left simply does not have the right's lasting power.<p>",,,,,,,,,,6,7,2004,NULL,NULL,0,4:30 - 6:00 p.m.,"Milken Institute<br>

""I wasn't going to argue that Eric Gange didn't have a great season,"" Rosenthal said. ""That was going nowhere.""<p>

Instead, he said, he compared his salary demands to other pitchers with his same three years of experience, like Mariano Rivera of the Yankees, who was awarded $4.25 million in 1999. <p>

The Dodgers offered Gagne $5 million, while the pitcher asked for $8 million. Agreeing to Gagne's demand would result in a record salary for a pitcher with only three years' experience, Rosenthal said.<p>

""Our case was not so much about Eric Gagne as it was about baseball's salary system,"" said Rosenthal in a breakfast meeting with members of the Milken Institute Associates.<p>

Clark II and Ted Bradshaw. <p>

Thanks not only to public-private partnerships pushing the move toward ""green"" energy supplies, but also to some forward-looking multinational corporations like General Electric, this shift is taking place across the globe, they said. <p>

""We're in the middle of a paradigm change,"" said Clark, a senior fellow at the Milken Institute. <p>

Clark and Bradshaw discussed their new book, <i>Agile Energy Systems, Global Lessons from the California Energy Crisis</i>, which offers a new approach to energy reliability and efficiency. <p>

Rather than the deregulation model, which has cost California some $40 billion, or a fully regulated energy system, the authors argue for one that is market-driven, but with a strong dose of government help and regulation. <p>

This system, they say, involves a much higher reliance on clean energies, like wind, sun and hydrogen, as well as hybrids of these and carbon-based fuels. <p>

""The deregulation model did not work and will not work,"" said Bradshaw, a professor at the University of California, Davis. ""Deregulation was a bad idea."" <p>

The key points of an ""agile"" energy system are: <p>

<ul>
<li> Diversified technologies <br>
<li> Distributed production<br>
<li> Renewable and clean natural energy sources<br>
<li> Interdependent (hybrid) and interchangeable<br>
<li> Quickly developable and promotes small businesses<br>
<li> Enhance the public good<br>
<li> Reliable and cost controlled</li>

To avoid electricity blackouts in the future, governments and companies must work together to build on a diversified sources of clean energy supplies. <p>

143,rt_fin_israel_0904,Financing Israel's Future: The Economic Reform Agenda &#151; A Progress Report,NULL,Forums,"Joseph Bachar, Director General of the Ministry of Finance for the State of Israel, said substantial progress has been made on Israel's economic front as it moves away from a government-run economy to one more dependent on open markets. <p>

Eighteen months ago, Bachar said, the government of Israel was in a near-crisis situation, exacerbated by the fact that, under those circumstances, it was unable to borrow in the foreign markets. Government expenditures were high, the deficit was growing and the market was shrinking, increasing the country's debt substantially.<p>

The good news on the political front was the tacit agreement between newly appointed Finance Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Prime Minister Ariel Sharon allowing Netanyahu to act without Sharon's interference. Israel, Bachar claims, benefited from that. <p>

As a result, the Ministry of Finance created a strict economic policy adopted by the government to reverse the crisis and sustain economic expansion. The four pillars of the government's new economic policy were to shrink the government, create incentives for people to go to work, reduce private sector taxes and privatize government businesses. There is a clear government commitment, Bachar said, to reducing government involvement in the economy. <p>

To ""shrink"" the government, it implemented a budget discipline that reduced government expenditures substantially &#151; for example, approving the first public-sector wage cuts in Israel's history. Guarantees received from the U.S. government also provided Israel with the opportunity to go to the foreign markets and borrow. Israel's commitment to sticking to its budget discipline was passed into law, sending a strong positive signal to the market. <p>

The government has also reduced welfare payments and reduced or eliminated personal tax rates for people earning low wages to provide them with incentives to go to work. Previously, Bachar said, too many people were better off staying at home than going to work. Government allowances for people who <i>could</i> go to work amounted to 6.4 percent of GDP (about $6.5 billion). All transfer payments in 2002 came to 13 percent of GDP. <p>

In conjunction with shrinking the public sector, Israel needed to give the private sector more fuel. It did this by creating private-sector incentives, among them, a reduction in the corporate tax rate to 30 percent from 36 percent by 2007 and of the VAT by 1 percent. <p>

Bachar also said the government is privatizing entities such as El Al, which would have been unheard of 20 years ago given security concerns. Its goal is to get out of the markets and become ""irrelevant"" over time.<p>

As Israel moves from a socialist to a capitalist economy, it has only just begun to develop its capital markets. Credit, Bachar pointed out, is virtually nonexistent through any intermediary other than its banks, which do 95 percent of the lending in the country. Credit card companies in Israel are also held by the banks. Capital is not only expensive, but Israel's two largest banks are government run. Very few people have access to capital, with 70 percent of lending going to 1 percent of the borrowers. Its goal is to increase competition by reducing concentration and conflicts of interest, opening the way for other financial intermediaries such as money market funds, mortgage-backed securities, deposit insurance, derivatives, etc. <p>

Bachar spoke to guests of the Milken Institute and the Government of Israel Economic Mission in Los Angeles, which co-hosted the event.

How much is spent on another great expanse about which we have much to learn &#151; earth's oceans? Only $630 million a year, said Jerry Schubel, President and CEO the Aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach, who led this roundtable discussion. <p>

As a coastal state with four of the 13 national marine sanctuaries, California needs to take a leadership position not only in vision, but in implementation of ocean conservation, he said. California is already a highly urbanized state. At its current rate of growth, 75 percent of the population will live within 50 miles of the coastline. <p>

California has paved 95 percent of its wetlands, creating impermeable land cover, transformed the watershed and created harbors where they did not exist. Marina del Rey is the largest small-craft harbor in the world and the port of Los Angeles/Long Beach is the third largest in the world. <p>

Melting snow caps due to global warming are contributing to our water shortage problem and the sea level is expected to rise at least six inches as a result, he said. <p>

These issues must be addressed now to prevent catastrophe in the not-too-distant future, Schubel said. <p>

We must create an environment that would have occurred naturally, he said. We have the knowledge; now we need the appropriate application by policy makers, scientists and the public. Furthermore, the model for protecting our coasts must be a regional one, he added. In the past, we've addressed individual problems along the coastline, but the impact extends well inland. <p>

A report on these issues, <i>An Ocean Blueprint for the 21st Century</i>, which was discussed by participants, cites five key areas for attention: <p>

1.	Improved governance <br>
2.	Sound science for wise decisions<br>
3.	Education of the public<br>
4.	Specific management challenges <br>
5.	Implementation and funding <p>

Action taken in California includes passage of the Marine Life Protection Act, The Marine Life Management Act, the Water Quality Bill and the California Beach Preservation Act, establishment of an ocean council, a $21-million coastal ocean currents monitoring system and engaging the philanthropic community in funding much of the work that needs to be done under these laws. <p>

Ultimately, heightened public awareness is critical to the success of ocean conservation, so a series of public service announcements is also being planned. <p>
Brian Baird, assistant secretary for ocean and coastal policy for the California Resource Agency, said that non-source pollution is the number one source of ocean pollution, and that people need to become aware of how their everyday actions impact the ocean before they will change their behavior. Local measures, he said, are often the most effective. <p>

Success will be the outcome of a shared vision of where we are headed, a partnership between local government and the public, and an annual accounting that demonstrates the economic benefits of action taken. <p>

In this talk, based on their book, <a href=""/publications/publications.taf?function=detail&ID=310&cat=Books""><i>The Savings and Loan Crisis: Lessons from a Regulatory Failure</i></a>, editors Glenn Yago and James Barth explained what led to these failures and, more importantly, what we learned from them.<p>

""The savings and loan crisis is a textbook case of financial institutions breaking down through a unique combination of macroeconomic conditions, interest rate and tax policy shifts, structural changes in capital markets and financial institutions, and, ultimately, regulatory chokeholds and policy missteps that created a perfect financial policy storm,"" said Yago, Director of Capital Studies at the Milken Institute.<p>

Among the missteps he cited were:<p>

<ul>
<li>Federal restrictions that kept S&Ls from participating in many financial activities, forcing them to rely on interest-rate-dependent home mortgages. <br>
<li>Poor incentives, which kept involvent S&Ls open far too long, thus adding to the final cleanup cost.<br>
<li>Misleading accounting procedures used by S&Ls.<br>
<li>Federal regulations that only exacerbated the problem. <br>
</li>
</ul> <p>

Yago said lawmakers, regulators, the Executive Branch and S&L executives all responded to the growing crisis too late, too slowly and too unevenly.<p>

""Most S&Ls didn't fall, but were pushed by government regulations,"" Yago said.<p>

Among the current concerns for U.S. regulators are the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC), the quasi-government agency that insures private pension plans and is $23 billion in the red, and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, two other government-sponsored institutions whose failure would inevitably be picked up by taxpayers. <p>

Barth also talked about China's financial system, where more than half of its bank assets are in state-owned banks, raising concerns for a potential crisis. <p>

Barth and Yago said the savings and loan crisis taught the important lesson that one must design banking regulations in such a manner as to allow institutions to adapt to changing competitive market forces. This message applies not just to the U.S., but also to every other country around the world &#151; almost all of which have suffered some kind of banking crisis in recent decades.<p>

To lessen the likelihood of similar financial industry collapses in the future, countries must have flexible banking laws and regulations, better accounting methods, and improve incentives for regulators and owners.<p>  

""The bottom line for us is the importance of democratizing capital markets to increase the level of economic participation in a way that allows for the diversification of risk and the maximization of rewards among a broader pool of people so they can finance the future &#151; of their homes, their businesses and their countries,"" Yago said. <p>
Yago is Director of Capital Studies at the Milken Institute. He specializes in financial innovations, financial institutions and capital markets, and has extensively analyzed public policy and its relation to high-yield markets, initial public offerings, restructuring, and job creation and retention strategies.<p>

Barth, a Milken Institute Senior Fellow, is the Lowder Eminent Scholar in Finance at Auburn University. His research has focused on financial institutions and capital markets, both domestic and global, with special emphasis on regulatory issues, most recently having served as leader of an international team advising the People's Bank of China on banking reform. Barth was an appointee of Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush as chief economist of the Office of Thrift Supervision until November 1989 and previously served as the chief economist of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, federal agencies overseeing the savings and loan industry.<p>

147,forum_pharma_1204,Pharmaceutical R&D: The Changing Economic Environment,NULL,Forums,"Despite an increase in pharmaceutical research and development spending, fewer and fewer drugs are being developed because companies today focus on the more profitable ""blockbuster"" drugs, said Senior Fellow Tomas Philipson. Because of this, there is less innovation taking place in the industry. <p>

The tradeoff, he added, is that often these blockbuster drugs have the ability to help a lot of people.<p>

""The industry is getting better at targeting big markets,"" Philipson said.<p>

Finding the right balance between profits, drug prices and innovation is tricky, he said. 
There are many forces battering the pharmaceutical industry's research and development abilities, both political and economic. <p>

One of the stickiest issues facing consumers, drug companies and government officials is how to lower prices for drugs, especially for seniors, while giving drug companies enough incentives to continue spending money on R&D innovation.<p>

By lowering prices on American drugs, you will inevitably reduce drug company profits, and thus, reduce the amount of money going into R&D. Doing this, Philipson said, would reduce the amount of new drugs coming to market &#151; or result in drugs that otherwise would have been created from not being produced at all.<p>

""We can make drugs cheap for seniors today, but the research and development investment would be substantially reduced,"" he said. The consequence of that, he added, is ""the next generation will be less healthy.""

Thus, today's debate over re-importation is not, as it is often described, a ""free-trade issue,"" but one involving ""intergenerational welfare,"" he said.<p>

On the related issue of whether the U.S. government should allow drug re-importation from Canada, Philipson said such a move would not significantly affect the cost of drugs to Americans, but could be very costly to Canadians.<p>

Because Canada represents such a small segment of the pharmaceutical market &#151; about 6 percent &#151; drug companies would not allow prices to their biggest market, the U.S., to come down to match Canada's. Rather, Canada's would come up to match those in the U.S., he said.<p>

Another tradeoff we make is the patents we give to new drugs, giving drug companies exclusive sales rights. This monopoly provides them with the profits they need to pour money back into developing new drugs, but the tradeoff is higher drug prices.<p>

In the debate over drug prices, the question often comes down to, which would you rather have &#151; new drugs or cheap drugs?<p>

""We haven't figured out an alternative for innovation, other than patents,"" Philipson said. Looking at current trends, he is ""cautiously pessimistic"" that this dynamic will change anytime soon. <p>

148,rt_hydrogen_1204,Hydrogen Highway Financial Innovations Laboratory,NULL,finlabs,"It is the stuff of novels, television drama and scientific conferences, but is the Hydrogen Highway a reality or mere wishful thinking?<p>

In January 2004, California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger introduced the California Hydrogen Highway Network to accelerate the introduction of a hydrogen-powered transportation system in California. Its purpose is to create a network of hydrogen stations throughout the state by 2010, reaching 2,000 stations and 2 million vehicles by 2030.<p> 

Is it viable? Many in the field seem to think so.<p> 

The Hydrogen Highway Financial Innovations Laboratory held Nov. 18 at the Institute brought together 30 experts in public and private finance, technology, industry and policy to discuss viable pathways to creating a ""hydrogen economy."" At the end of the day, the participants, who broke into focus groups addressing financing mechanisms, technological development, societal issues and cross-cutting solutions, came up with recommendations to be submitted to Schwarzenegger.<p>

The essential ingredients of a viable hydrogen economy, the group agreed, were political will and cash. Despite formidable barriers to implementation, motivation is also a driving force toward achieving that end. Early-stage key players identified by the group were hydrogen producers and equipment manufacturers. These include government, project financiers, big auto OEMs, energy utilities, hydrogen retailers (stations) and renewable-energy players. Initial end users identified were fleets and government, and only in the long-term, public consumers.<p>

A clearly identified downside was the lack of private capital available for infrastructure. Venture capitalists are not interested in government-subsidized markets, nor will private investors fund projects that have no revenue stream for at least five years. Private investors need clearly defined, focused opportunities, they said, as well as a broader market than one limited to California. On the upside, while infrastructure will have to be funded by public means, models exist for converting government-built infrastructure to private projects, among them, the solar industry and the defense industry.<p>

In the technology and public policy arenas, members determined that the central issue is how to direct current technology toward the policy of hydrogen economy. They also looked at existing infrastructure that could be utilized in this regard, including railroad and cell-phone infrastructure, military bases and Cal Trans stations, and agreed to study natural gas to determine the existence of a parallel track.<p>

Among the societal drivers cited were energy scarcity, energy diversity, carbon dioxide emissions and global warming, yielding benefits such as better air quality, job creation and export opportunities.<p>

The general consensus emerged that hydrogen is the energy future, leaving the question of how California becomes a leader in that future. Public awareness and buy-in were considered critical by the group and they raised the possibility of an initiative similar to the voter-approved stem cell initiative as a starting point.<p>

The technology team felt that, realistically, hydrogen would gain a major foothold among the population closer to the year 2030, citing the cost of the car as one factor and hydrogen's adoption as a commodity by major oil companies as another.<p>",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,11,18,2004,NULL,NULL,0,NULL,"Santa Monica, CA",NULL,0,0,NULL,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,NULL,"{length = 8, bytes = 0x0000000000240e87}",NULL,NULL,NULL,2005-10-21 10:30:22.000,2005-10-21 10:30:22.000,2004-11-18 00:00:00.000,NULL,NULL,38307,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL
149,forum_made_america_1204,They Made America - From the Steam Engine to the Search Engine,NULL,Forums,"<i>They Made America</i> is the title of his book, and in his 90-minute appearance at the Milken Institute, author Sir Harold Evans made it clear why the innovators he writes about indeed helped make America what it is today. <p>

These are not just people who discovered or invented things. These are entrepreneurs who took discoveries and ideas and turned them into products that millions of people could use and enjoy.<p>

""Edison learned to only make things that people wanted,"" Evans said. ""That's what Americans are good at.""<p>

Among the innovators in his pantheon that Evans cited during his talk were:<p>

<ul>
  <li> Sam Colt, inventor of the repeating revolver, which changed warfare. <br>
<li> Isaac Singer, inventor of the Singer sewing machine, which vastly improved productivity and employment in the clothing industry.<br>
<li> Lewis Tappan, who in the 1800s, created the world's first credit rating system.<br>
<li> Theodore Judah, who gave us the transcontinental railway, linking California with the rest of America.<br>
<li> Leo Baekeland, who created plastic.<br>
<li> Amadeo Giannini, who created ""the people's bank"" &#151; today's Bank of America &#151; by liberalizing lending policies to help the middle class and working people. <br>
<li> Martha Harper, a servant girl who started America's first retail franchise network.<br>
<li> Juan Trippe, whose company, Pan American Airways, pioneered commercial jet airline travel.<br>
<li> Ida Rosenthal, who produced the Maidenform bra.<br>
<li> Samuel Insull, who helped bring cheap electricity to the masses.<br>
<li> Jean Nidetch, who started Weight Watchers.
<li> Estee Lauder, who founded the international cosmetics company.<br>
<li> Malcom McLean, who came up with the idea of placing trucking containers directly on ships &#151; an innovation that created today's global marketplace.<br>
<li> Gary Kildall, the founder of the personal computer revolution.<br>
<li> Herbert Boyer, who helped usher in the biotechnology era.<br>
<li> Raymond Damadian, who developed the MRI, allowing doctors to see the inside of the human body.</li>
</ul> <p>

A common element among these innovators, Evans said, is they created things that allowed many more people to enjoy what previously only the rich or elite could take advantage of, from airline travel and cars to cameras and electricity. <p>

They also tended to be common people with extraordinary ideas. <p>

""So many innovations came from ordinary people, from unexpected sources,"" Evans said. ""That's the nature of innovation."" <p>
Evans is an historian, author and journalist with a distinguished career leading some of the world's most well-known newspapers and magazines. He was the editor of the <i>Sunday Times of London</i> for 14 years and then the <i>Times of London</i> before coming to the U.S. in 1984.

But it has also become a lightning rod for some of the most contentious public policy issues of our time &#151; from the re-importation of drugs from Canada to the drug approval process. <p>

Finding common ground on these issues is important to not only patients, but the drug companies themselves, whose ability to develop news drugs depends on their ability to get a return on their research and development dollars, said Senior Fellow <a href=""/about/about.taf?function=detail&Level1=ProStaff&Level2=Bio&ID=39&cat=Staff"">Tomas Philipson</a>, a professor in the Irving B. Harris Graduate School of Public Policy Studies at the University of Chicago.<p>

Philipson, an expert on the economics of health care, discussed the many forces that are affecting these returns, including the recently approved Medicare Modernization Act. The drug benefit plan portion of this legislation, which becomes effective on Jan. 1, 2006, is government's effort to address the increasing demand from our growing elderly population and is evidence of a general downward pressure on drug prices, he said.<p>

Also threatening the return on the industry's R&D investment is the increase in the popularity of cheaper generic drugs.<p>

""Half the prescriptions written today are generic, up from 18 percent in 1984,"" said Philipson.<p>

Although R&D spending has increased, the number of new pharmaceutical products introduced to the market has actually decreased, he said. The challenge is finding the appropriate balance or ""trade-off between speed-to-market and drug safety issues."" <p>

In addition to the School of Public Policy Studies, Philipson is a faculty member of the University of Chicago Department of Economics and law school. Philipson recently served as Senior Economic Advisor to the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration and the administrator of The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. <p>

But he is not overly optimistic.<p>

""Abbas fully believes that violence has completely backfired,"" said Gold during a private meeting at the Milken Institute. ""From a tactical perspective, he believes it doesn't work."" <p>

However, strategically Abbas does not appear willing to actually dismantle the terrorists' infrastructure of Hamas or his Fatah organization, Gold added. For that reason, getting Abbas to convince those who support violence to stop their attacks against Israel remains a tall order, he said.<p>

""Can he stop the attacks?"" Gold asked. ""The jury is still out.""<p>

According to Gold, the near-term future will bring three developments:<p>

<ul>
  <li> Abbas will have continuing trouble from the fundamentalist groups like Hamas, as well has his own Fatah faction. <br>
<li> Increased military action by Israel is likely.<br>
<li> It will be difficult to get a full-time cease-fire in place.<br>
  </li>
</ul><p>

In addition to his remarks about the peace process, Gold also touched on a number of other subjects, including Iraq, Israel's internal politics and the proposed withdraw of Israel from Gaza.<p>

Gold is President of the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs. He was the 11th Permanent Representative of Israel to the United Nations (1997-1999) and foreign policy advisor to former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He also served as an advisor to Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, with whom he traveled to Washington and attended the 2003 Aqaba Summit with President George W. Bush.<p>

Well, think again, says USC Professor Larry Harris, author of <i>Trading and Exchanges: Market Microstructure for Practitioners,</i> a book about why people trade.<p> 

If you're like many people, your main purpose in trading is retirement &#151; either saving for it or selling stocks to pay for it. But there are a whole lot of other people out there trading for many other reasons. And since the equities markets need winners as well as losers to operate efficiently, you can't make money unless you take advantage of others' blunders, said Harris.<p> 

""Trading is, ultimately, a zero-sum game,"" he said. ""Understanding why people trade &#151; and with whom they're trading &#151; is very important. If you're going to beat the market, you have to find out who's making mistakes.""<p>

Among the most common mistakes that traders make, he said, are:
<p>
&#8226; I gambled when I intended to speculate.<br>
&#8226; I tried to speculate when I intended to invest.<br>
&#8226; I held on because I wanted to be right.<br> 
&#8226; I traded on stale information.<br>
&#8226; I traded on the wrong model.<br> 
&#8226; I traded when liquidity was scarce.<br>
&#8226; I traded too much.</li><p>

Harris offered the audience a taxonomy of various types of traders, from speculators to dealers, hedgers to tax avoiders. Some trade based on news about a certain industry or company. Others trade because they think they know something others don't and can ""beat"" the market.<p>

Ultimately, Harris said, trading is not just about being smart or having good ideas. Just like in a sport, you have to know the other players and their weaknesses.<p>

""Winning requires good ideas,"" he said, ""but you also have to understand why the other side will lose.""<p>
Larry Harris is the immediate past chief economist of the Securities and Exchange Commission, where he contributed extensively to the development of regulations implementing Sarbanes-Oxley and to the resolution of the mutual fund timing crisis.<p>

He left the commission in July 2004 to resume his appointment as the Fred V. Keenan Chair in Finance at the USC Marshall School of Business. Professor Harris is an expert in market microstructure and investment management.

Citing three sectors in particular that have become profitable niches for trial lawyers in California &#151; construction defects, employment and securities class-action &#151; James Copland, Director of the Manhattan Institute's Center for Legal Policy, said litigators have a tight grip on the state.

""It's time to return balance and common sense to the civil justice system,"" he said. <p>

158,EID158,Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything,NULL,Forums,"When they first agreed to collaborate on a story, University of Chicago economist Steven Levitt and <i>New York Times</i> writer Stephen Dubner didn't think too much would come of it. Levitt didn't understand why a reporter would be interested in his sometimes arcane, often counter-intuitive economic theories, and Dubner didn't think that many people would read a story about an economist. <p>

They were both wrong. <p>

Many book tours and a best-seller later, both men say they are surprised at the popularity of Levitt's theories and of their book, <i>Freakonomics</i>. <p>

Speaking in front of a full house at the Milken Institute, Levitt and Dubner described some of the research findings, which are also outlined in their book, including: <p>

<ul>
<li> The misguided solution &#151; a $3 fine &#151; that a day-care center came up with to cut down on the number of parents who showed up late to pick up their children. In essence, the fine told parents it was OK to be late as long as you were willing to pay, and thus, late pickups actually <i>increased</i>. <br>
<li> The discovery, through a detailed examination of test scores, that teachers in the Chicago Public School system were cheating to raise the test scores of their students. The incentive? Teachers whose students tested poorly could be passed over for a raise or promotion. <br>
<li> The economics of the crack cocaine business and why, as their book put it, ""drug dealers still live with their moms."" The bottom line: the hierarchy of drug dealers is not much different than the average fast-food chain. Those at the top make a lot of money, but those at the bottom make very little. <br>
<li> The bagel man &#151; the businessman who learned the fine points of honesty and dishonesty in office workers when he left collection boxes for payment. (Examples: Workers in smaller offices are more honest than those in big ones; and unseasonably good weather results in more payments than unseasonably bad weather.) </li>
</ul> <p>

The key to his findings, Levitt said, is knowing what to measure and how to measure it &#151; and having the data to study. <p>

""At its root, economics is the study of incentives,"" Levitt said. <p>

It could also increase oil by $10 a barrel and lead to a nearly 1 percent decline in GDP growth in the fourth quarter of this year. <p>

But next year, when the reconstruction efforts get into full swing, the recovery will turn things around &#151; adding those 30,000 jobs back per month, easing the price of oil and increasing the GDP by more than a percentage point during the second and third quarters.<p>

These are the preliminary findings of two of the Milken Institute's regional economists who've studied the potential impact of Katrina on the U.S. and Gulf economies.<p>

Ross DeVol, Director of Regional Economics, and Perry Wong, Senior Research Economist, told members of the Milken Institute Associates that based on what has happened after previous natural disasters, the short-term job losses will be made up by increases in such areas as construction once rebuilding is fully under way.<p>

And given the perception by many in the public that the federal government did not respond fast enough to the Katrina disaster, DeVol expects a massive outlay of federal dollars in the rebuilding effort. <p>

""There will be no expense spared,"" DeVol said.<p>

Insurance payouts for Katrina are expected to be the most for any hurricane cleanup in U.S. history &#151; anywhere from $20 billion to $45 billion. The federal government could end up spending as much as $150 billion.<p>

One of the key questions is how to rebuild New Orleans, which is dependent on tourism and lacks the knowledge-based workforce that is crucial for economic growth.<p>

""It's not just the rebuilding that's important, but what kind of rebuilding we do,"" said Wong. ""The danger is if we try to put it back just as it was.""<p>

<i><b>Update:</b> After Hurricane Rita hit the Gulf Coast in September, DeVol and Wong updated their findings about the impact of the two hurricanes on the local and national economies. Their findings can be found in the slides (above), but here is a summary:</i> <p>

Delayed economic activity caused by the massive evacuations in the Houston region, combined with the economic dislocations in the affected area, will reduce real GDP growth by an additional 0.2 percentage point in the third and fourth quarters of 2005 beyond the 0.5 and 1.0 percent reductions already anticipated due to Hurricane Katrina. Reported job growth will be reduced by an additional 5,000 per month, on top of the 30,000 attributable to Katrina, for the remainder of 2005. The price of natural gas should increase by nearly $1 per million British thermal unit from what would have been expected before Rita hit. <p>

Rita may also delay the reconstruction efforts in New Orleans somewhat because of renewed flooding, but rebuilding will still turn things around in 2006 &#151; adding back 30,000 jobs per month from Katrina, plus another 4,000 per month in southeast Texas and southwest Louisiana. The easing of oil and refined-petroleum-products prices, along with reconstruction, will increase GDP growth by more than a percentage point during the second and third quarters of 2006.<p>

161,EID161,Structural Reform in the Israeli Capital Market,NULL,Forums,"Israel has made great economic strides in the last two decades thanks to a series of economic reforms packages begun in 1985 and tight economic policies designed to control inflation. <p>

But as Amir Barnea stated in his visit to the Milken Institute, there is still a ways to go as Israel moves away from a government-controlled economy to one more driven by market forces.<p>

Capital-market development has been identified as a fundamental strategy for Israel. The biggest obstacle in this task is reforming the banking sector to allow for a viable secondary market. Israel's banking sector is largely dominated by two banks that account for 63 percent of both total assets and deposits in the sector. Furthermore, loans account for 81 percent of corporate-debt financing in Israel, of which 74 percent are bank loans. And of these bank loans, 66 percent are from the two largest banks. This large concentration in banking exposes the banks to financial risks, forcing them to absorb much of the economic loss during recessions, as seen in 2001.<p>

Barnea, a professor of Finance at the Arison School of Business at the Interdisciplinary Center, Herziliya, who has been helping lead the country's reform efforts, said that diversification of risk is crucial to protecting Israel's economy against future financial shocks, as well as promoting efficient and open markets. A series of reforms being considered includes implementing regulatory standards for banks by encouraging them to divest their interest in provident fund management, insurance and mutual funds to other entities. <p>

The proposed reforms will allow the capital markets to introduce new financial instruments such as asset-backed securities and securitization for Israel. This will ultimately benefit entrepreneurial activity, attract foreign investment and provide capital access for investors by enhancing the efficiency and sophistication of Israel's capital markets.<p>

Barnea, in partnership with the Milken Institute, hopes to monitor &#151; on a monthly basis &#151; the effects of the reforms to determine changes in the cost of intermediation, consumer choice, and the cost of credit and their impact on the economy.<p>

On the right are those who have total faith in pro-growth policies. On the left are those who want to slow down globalization and offer more protections for workers. Both views are recipes for trouble, said Sperling. <p>

The pro-growth approach helps mainly the wealthy and has created a ""winner-take-all"" economy. The protectionism course slows down the pace of inevitable change and innovation in a global economy, which can hurt job creation.<p>

Fortunately, Sperling said, there's a third way, which he describes as the ""pro-growth progressive"" approach.<p>

""Our goal is not GDP growth per se,"" Sperling said. ""Our vision is an America that grows together. We either grow together or we grow apart."" <p>

Sperling said changes in technology and the global marketplace have roiled markets and businesses worldwide, as low-wage countries like India and China take a bigger and bigger share of the economy.<p>

That has led to some disruptions in the U.S. labor market, which has jeopardized middle-class jobs, he said. We need policies that will help workers affected by globalization get themselves back on their feet.<p>

""We have to make falling less severe,"" he said.<p>

While criticizing Republicans for not doing enough to help the middle and lower classes, Sperling added that Democrats can't just be the party ""when things go bad."" They must have positive ideas. They need to talk about wealth creation. They need an optimistic message.<p>

164,EID164,Rethinking Bank Regulation: Till Angels Govern,NULL,Forums,"After six years of research that involved two in-depth surveys, hundreds of questions, painstaking cross-checking of data and exhaustive follow-up, James Barth and Gerard Caprio realized there is tremendous diversity in banking supervisory and regulatory practices around the world. <p>

This made answering the question, ""Which banking system works best?"" all the more important.<p>

How much diversity did they find? Examples:<p>

<i>Does the size of a country's banking system matter?</i> In Germany, bank assets represent 361 percent of GDP, while in the U.S. it's 64 percent and in Sudan only 14 percent. <p>

<i>Does government ownership of banks matter? </i>In China, 98 percent of the banking assets are government owned, while in India, the government owns 75 percent. In the U.S., the government owns no banks. <p>

<i>Does the amount of assets in foreign banks matter?</i> In Italy, only 6 percent of banking assets are foreign-owned, while that number is 19 percent in the U.S. and 99 percent in New Zealand.<p>

In addition, Barth and Caprio said, each country's regulatory system is different. For instance, half of the 152 countries they and colleague Ross Levine surveyed have explicit deposit insurance policies, while the other half none. Restrictions on the activities in which banks may engage differ country by country. So do the supervisory powers in each country.<p>

So given all of these differences, what system works best? What rules and regulations should countries adopt to ensure the most efficient banking system? <p>

Barth, Caprio and Levine &#151; authors of a new book, <i>Rethinking Bank Regulation: Till Angels Govern</i>, which is based on their research &#151; found that:<p>

<ul>
  <li> Open, competitive, democratic political institutions foster private monitoring and transparency. These countries are less likely to limit bank entry and activities and are less likely to have state banks.<br>
<li> Closed, uncompetitive, autocratic political systems do not favor transparency. These countries limit bank entry and activities and tend to have state banks.</li>
</ul><p>

Based on their research, Barth and Caprio said, they reached the following conclusions:<p>

<ul>
  <li>Countries should avoid relying on bank-activity restrictions, stringent official powers and state ownership.<br>
<li>They should emphasize private monitoring and avoid generous deposit-insurance schemes.<br>
<li>They should foster/force information disclosure.  </li>
</ul> <p>

Most important, they said, supervisors have a crucial role in governing the financial system, but governments should support market discipline, not supplant it with intrusive regulation and supervision.<p>

""It's the private sector's ability to monitor that matters more to the health of the banking system (than supervision),"" Caprio said.<p>

Finally, they said, no one size fits all. Given the complexities of each country's economic, legal and political systems, and their individual conditions and needs, there is no simple set of ""best practices"" to banking regulation in countries around the world.<p>

Does this all matter? Of course, Barth said. ""A stable and well-functioning banking system is critical for economic growth and development.""<p>

""This is a serious problem that we need to address, and the longer it takes, the worse it will get,"" he said in a meeting with Milken Institute Associates. <p>

At issue is the ability of these funds to pay the promised benefits to their retirees &#151; a gap that is growing as people live longer. How corporations will pay for these benefits &#151; and what happens if they can't &#151; is a vital question for both the companies and government. <p>

169,EID169,Government Failure Versus Market Failure,NULL,Forums,"For all the official enthusiasm about free markets, Washington still intervenes in the American economy in myriad ways. Indeed, while both Democrats and Republicans talk the talk of markets unleashed, they rarely walk the walk &#151; the political logic of intervention usually dominates the economic logic of deregulation. <p> 
The question is: Does government intervention help? Is it necessary? Or, when it is required, are the remedies picked by Washington the right ones?<p>
Clifford Winston, a Senior Fellow in Economic Studies at the Brookings Institution, argues that in almost all cases, the answer to those questions is no.<p>
""Intervention is often unnecessary,"" he said. And when it is required, ""There are missed opportunities to improve (market) efficiencies.""<p>
In some cases, Winston said, government policies have forced the private sector to incur compliance costs where there is little evidence that markets have failed. In other cases, where markets have clearly failed, intervention has done little or nothing to increase efficiency.<p>
He discussed some of the most common market failures where Washington intervenes, such as monopolies, collusion and mergers, where government tries to protect consumers from high prices, misleading advertising and so on by creating new regulations.<p>
The problem, he said, is government's response is often unnecessary, inadequate or even counterproductive.<p>
In cases where the Justice Department fought mergers it felt would be harmful to consumers, for example, the end results often weren't lower prices. <p>
One reason that markets do a better job than the government in dealing with market failures is that government regulations tend to suppress innovation, he said.<p>

""It's innovations that spur the economy,"" he said. ""Government's hand prevents that.""<p>

Even when government intervention is called for, it's important that lawmakers do a cost-benefit analysis to make sure the price taxpayers pay is worth it. It would also help if lawmakers learned from past mistakes and picked solutions that would have the desired outcome &#151; something they generally haven't done because of political concerns.<p>

Winston, an expert in industrial organization, has long specialized in the economics of transportation. His research on airline deregulation, which quantified the benefits of allowing the carriers to fly where they chose and to charge whatever they chose, is widely recognized as the definitive analysis of this sea change in public policy. He is the author of numerous books, including his most recent, <i>Deregulation of Network Industries: What's Next?</i>, with Sam Peltzman. He received his A.B. in economics from the University of California at Berkeley in 1974, his M.Sc. from the London School of Economics in 1975, and his Ph.D. in economics from U.C.

But despite these advances, cancer, Alzheimer's, diabetes and other illnesses continue to devastate individuals and families. <p>

One of the primary weapons in this battle is the development of new drugs that can cure or offset the effects of these diseases. But because of the enormous costs of developing new drugs, the length of time to get them to market and the high risks for investors, the discovery of new life-saving medicines has slowed.<p>

This financial innovations lab, and a similar one in New York City on Dec. 13, focused on how we can use creative financial techniques to increase investment in medical research and commercialization. A diverse group of experts in finance, medicine, philanthropy and intellectual property met to help figure out what new financial instruments and strategies could be created to break the drug-discovery finance logjam.<p>

""People are dying who shouldn't be dying,"" said Glenn Yago, Director of Capital Studies at the Institute, who hosted the event.<p>

Attendees agreed that fundamental shifts that have taken place in the pharmaceutical industry over the past five years that make it more difficult to fund research for promising, but early-stage drugs.<p>

With the cost of getting a new drug to market estimated at $800 million, many drug companies now rely on smaller biotechnology firms to pay the bill for this research. But venture capital funding for these small companies has dried up because investors don't want to take the risk of losing their money on unproven drugs. They're more interested in drugs that have proven themselves in late-stage clinical trials.<p>

As a result, it's tough to put deals together that will help move these potentially life-saving drugs along the research pipeline, they said.<p>

""Pharmacology is the most difficult (industry) I've faced,"" said Joe Daniele, chief operating officer of Acorn Technologies, Inc., who has completed more than 350 IP deals over the years.<p>

Lab members talked about what has worked and not worked to help fill this funding gap, such as special purpose vehicles and structured finance, and how you value intellectual property such as drug patents.<p>

But much of the focus was on a financial instrument strongly supported by research at the Milken Institute: securitization &#151; or the pooling of assets that can be sold as a security. <p>

Is there a way, for example, to estimate the future value of royalties over a number of years from a portfolio of patents relevant to a particular disease group or medical problem? This portfolio could then be turned into marketable securities, which would provide capital to accelerate research.<p>

Attendees also discussed how insurance companies or foundations whose missions are aligned with particular diseases might help bridge the financing gap by, for instance, providing loan-loss guarantees. This would require a fundamental shift in the thinking of foundations, many agreed.<p>

The objective of the labs is to explore a range of market-based alternatives to closing the early-stage funding gap and accelerate cure development for infectious and chronic diseases. Designing capital structures with credit enhancement, advanced sales and other financial, marketing or business strategies that align interests of foundations, investors, patients, governments and businesses is expected to advance health solutions.<p>

171,EID171,L.A. Economy Project: Financial Innovations for Capital Access,NULL,finlabs,"This lab brought together business leaders, bankers, community organizers and researchers to act on the capital-access recommendations presented in the Milken Institute's Los Angeles Economy Project report. It was one of several meetings of L.A. leaders prompted by the release of the project's report in December 2005. <p>

""These meetings,"" said Los Angeles City Council President Eric Garcetti, ""act as a bridge between research and legislation and action...with the goal of increased participation in the Los Angeles economy."" <p>

Key speakers at this lab included Kirsten Snow Spalding of the California Pollution Control Financing Authority, who talked about the California Capital Access Program (CalCAP); Ian Cudlipp of Four Corners Capital Management, who discussed collateralized loan obligations; and Shari Berenbach of the Calvert Foundation, who presented information on community investment notes.  <p>

Several recommendations and action items emerged from the meeting: <p>

<b>Use L.A. partners to increase California Capital Access Program activity in Los Angeles. </b><p>
 
This program would operate within CalCAP, and would bolster CalCAP loans to L.A.-based businesses.  In the state program, the lender and borrower generally each pay 2 percent of the loan amount into a loan loss reserve, and the state contributes a 4 percent match. This 8 percent reserve mitigates the lender's risk. CalCAP has a provision for an independent contributor to create incentives by helping to cover the borrower's or lender's costs. In an L.A.-focused program, the independent contractor could be the City of Los Angeles or a local foundation.  In addition to, or in lieu of, offsetting the borrower's or lender's contribution to the loan loss reserve, the contributor might also help pay the lender's cost of marketing and loan origination, increasing outreach and usage of the program. The program could be sector- or neighborhood-specific, and would make use of existing infrastructure. <p>

<i>Next Steps:</i> Gain mayoral and City Council support; secure an independent contributor. <p>

<b>Develop an L.A. Community Investment Note</b><p>

The Calvert Community Foundation can help structure an L.A.-targeted Community Investment Note, to be marketed to local institutions and investors. Notes would likely be at least $5,000 (though could be as little as $1,000), with a flexible interest rate to be chosen by the investor (generally between 0 percent and 3 percent) and term between one and 10 years.  Funds raised by the notes would be invested in local community development financial institutions. Local foundations and philanthropists could credit-enhance the loan pool to help mitigate the risk as well as help support the cost of marketing and originating loans, and due diligence and placement of proceeds. In addition to small-business lending, funds could be used for affordable housing and community development. Calvert has created similar customized note programs, including a geographically focused effort for the Gulf Coast in the wake of Hurricane Katrina.  <p>

<i>Next Steps:</i>  Identify lenders, philanthropic organizations, individuals and government agencies who might contribute to the cost and management of the program; explore structuring options with the Calvert Foundation. <p>

<b>Develop an L.A.-focused Small-Business Collateralized Loan Obligation</b><p>

Collateralized loan obligations (CLOs) can increase lending activity by purchasing loans and offering lenders liquidity. If the loans are packaged and credit-enhanced with a layer of equity (perhaps from a local foundation) or insurance wrap, the resulting security could be rated and prove attractive to institutional investors (e.g. LACERS, CalPERS) or banks seeking CRA credit. Currently some small-business loans are securitized, but an L.A.-focused CLO would pool many more local small-business loans. A diversity of industries and types of loans could be included. The servicing of the loans could be maintained by the original lender or passed to the purchaser. Philanthropic support could help cover the marketing costs. <p>

<i>Next Steps:</i> Identify pools of potential loans to be included; identify potential philanthropic and government partners. <p>

175,EID175,Financial Innovations for Faster Cures: Securitization of Medical Solutions II,NULL,finlabs,"Following up on the first Financial Innovations Lab, which examined how creative financial techniques may be able to bridge the funding gaps in medical research, a diverse group of financial, legal, philanthropic, insurance and medical-research experts met in New York to discuss the specifics of how this can be done. <p>

With the cost to produce new drugs growing more expensive (reportedly, as much as $800 million), increased regulatory scrutiny and fewer blockbuster drugs to help the bottom line, research-and-development activity has declined at the major pharmaceutical companies, resulting in fewer new drugs being discovered. <p>

One problem is the enormous risk to investors because of the long time frame involved for bringing new drugs to market, and the huge uncertainty of whether they'll pan out. <p>

So the question to those attending this lab was simple: What innovative financial structures have evolved that could be applied to the biopharmaceutical industry that would reduce this risk to investors and pump more money into medical research &#151; especially early-stage drug discovery? <p>

""Why is it that the large pharmaceutical industry, which was once a full-service provider in drug development, has continued to withdraw from risky early-stage discovery and development?"" asked Glenn Yago, Director of Capital Studies at the Milken Institute. ""Why is it that the venture capital market and equity investors have been avoiding support for risky early-stage discovery and development? And how do we overcome this?"" <p>

Attendees spent the day looking at a variety of potential mechanisms, such as special-purpose vehicles, structured finance and the securitization &#151; the pooling of assets that can be sold as a security &#151; of intellectual property, like drug patents. <p>

Jeffrey Brandt, a patent attorney, agreed that a well-assembled portfolio can have a value greater than the sum of its parts. But there are risks. <p>

""Owning intellectual property is like having a tiger by the tail,"" said Brandt, who is President of JLB Consulting Inc. ""The good news is you own a tiger. The bad news is you've got it by the tail. You're probably going to have to do something with it. You need to understand what you own in terms of using it."" <p>

Among the major issues are finding the right financial instrument, the right disease, the right patents and the right stakeholders to reduce the risk and ensure the best outcome. Jay Eisbruck, Managing Director of Moody's Investors Service, said this would not be easy. <p>

""The only way to make it work would be to cross-collateralize all these different drugs into one deal,"" he said. But ""everyone is going to think their drug is going to be more successful than everyone else's, so they're going to not necessarily want to share the benefits of that. To make this work, you would have to find a way to get people to at least subordinate some of the benefit of their drugs for the benefit of the overall transaction to make it work."" <p>

Many venture capitalists have pulled out or cut back on their investments, attendees said. <p>

""Venture capitalists are becoming more risk-averse,"" said Martha Amram, an author and Founder of Growth Options Insights, LLC. ""So we have a gap here of how to reduce the risk further so additional funding sources will come in."" <p>

By involving many of the different players in these discussions &#151; insurance companies and foundations, for example, that could help bridge the financing gap &#151; Milken Institute researchers hope to forge agreement on new ways to fund drug research. <p>

The objective of the labs is to explore a range of market-based alternatives to closing the early-stage funding gap and accelerate cure development for infectious and chronic diseases. <p>

176,EID176,Mexico's Arrested Development,NULL,mia,"Solving the issue of illegal immigration will take more than fences and green cards on the American side. It will take drastic reform of Mexico's economy and social structures to enable both Mexican entrepreneurs and U.S. investors to build companies and create jobs south of the border. <p>

This examination of Mexico's economy and needed reforms was presented by Milken Institute Senior Fellow Joel Kurtzman and Glenn Yago, Director of Capital Studies, at a special briefing for members of the Milken Institute Associates. <p>

According to both researchers, Mexico has tremendous economic potential that it's not reaching because of a lack of transparency in its markets, corruption and security issues that not only keep out vital foreign investment, but also make it difficult for Mexican entrepreneurs to get the capital they need to build a business and create jobs. <p>

""The Mexican economy is operating at half capacity,"" said Kurtzman. <p>
Because of this, Mexico forgoes an estimated 2.6 percent of GDP each year due to the poor way in which its institutions function and another 2 percent due to things like corruption, Kurtzman and Yago said. If Mexico reformed its institutions and cleaned up corruption, it could grow at Chinese rates, they added. <p>
Nearby Mexico is losing out to faraway China. Mexico's share of U.S. imports is declining compared to China. As late as 2001, Mexico's share of U.S. imports was close to 12 percent, while China's was only about 8 percent. In 2005, while Mexico's share dropped to under 11 percent, China's had climbed to nearly 16 percent. <p>
By reforming its economy &#151; including its vital energy industry &#151; Mexico can begin to improve its investment climate, thus producing more jobs that will keep its citizens at home. Failure to do anything will cause Mexico's economy to stagnate, sending yet more immigrants north, Kurtzman and Yago said. <p>

177,EID177,Chinese Lessons: Five Classmates and the Story of the New China,NULL,Forums,"John Pomfret, Los Angeles Bureau Chief for the <i>Washington Post</i> presented an insider's view of China, having spent a year at Nanjing University as a 20-year-old Stanford University exchange student and, years later, returning to China as a journalist to cover the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, eventually becoming the <i> Post</i>'s Beijing bureau chief.<p> He noted the striking contrast between the sterile China of the 1980s and the booming China of today: brighter colors, extraordinary GDP growth, increased defense spending and higher caloric intake through foreign fast food. But this positive economic development, he cautioned, may come at the expense of social contentment and personal freedoms.<p>

The Chinese government is making bets it may not win, he said. The first bet is that ""by relying on reforming the economy first and politics later, or never, China will never have a revolution."" Yet tensions are ripe for revolution, with state-owned enterprise closures and rural land seizures. Although China experienced a social and sexual revolution under Deng Xiaoping, a strong economy without additional political and social reform cannot pacify unrest indefinitely.<p>

""The government is betting China will get rich before it gets old,"" said Pomfret, author of the new book, <i>Chinese Lessons: Five Classmates and the Story of the New China</i>. The population is living longer, while births are at an all-time low. The elderly, who will make up 28 percent of the population by 2040, have no traditional safety nets to support them, potentially increasing poverty rates exponentially. Gender-selective abortions, though illegal, have resulted in a huge gender gap, leaving ""an army of unmarried males"" who may cause social unrest.<p>

Further, the Chinese government largely ignores environmental disasters, favoring economic growth over environmental protection. Pomfret illustrated this with the story of extreme pollution in the Huai River caused by factory overdevelopment. The river water was so polluted that the locals who relied on it for drinking water were found to have high metal counts in their urine. The government eventually closed several factories and imposed environmental regulations but chose to reopen them when rural unemployment rates rose.<p>

Finally, in direct contrast with the China of old, modern China assumes it can become a great nation without strong belief systems. The government shuts down attempts at organized religion, such as the Falun Gong movement, slowly ""killing the human spirit"" and causing Chinese to ""lose their moral compass."" Some have turned to traditional Confucianism, but a recent sex-trafficking scandal involving a religious leader has cast a cloud over the legitimacy of religious movements. Further, although Chinese tire of government telling them what to think, they ""continue to live in the government system they despise.""<p>

China has heavy reliance on economic development with little concern for the every-growing gap between the ""haves"" and the ""have-nots,"" said Pomfret. If the central government begins to focus more on political openness and reform rather than solely on economic growth, it may quell potential social unrest.<p>

179,MIA101206,Associates Breakfast with Donald Marron,NULL,mia,"Donald Marron, Acting Director of the Congressional Budget Office (COB), had some good news for members of the Milken Institute Associates: The federal deficit in 2006 dropped to its lowest level in three years - $248 billion. He said this is mainly due to higher tax revenues than anticipated. <p>

But, as he told members of the Milken Institute Associates, there are some serious challenges ahead, such as aging baby boomers and the growing costs of Social Security and Medicare. If something isn't done to change the dynamics of those programs, these mandatory-spending programs will take up a larger and larger share of the federal budget, he said. <p>

And if health-care costs continue to rise faster than the overall economy as predicted, Social Security will be the ""easy one"" compared to Medicare, he added. <p>

Overall, federal budget spending is falling back into line with historic averages, Marron said. This year's deficit, for example, is about 1.9 percent of GDP, which he described as ""neither large nor small"" by historic standards. <p>

Marron became CBO's deputy director in October 2005 and began serving as acting director as of December 30. In this role, he manages CBO and regularly consults with the budget committees to ensure that the agency's work and capacities meet and keep pace with Congressional demands. <p>

Previously, Marron served as chief economist for the President's Council of Economic Advisers. In that capacity, he analyzed a broad range of fiscal, regulatory and macroeconomic policies and directed a team that monitored the state of the economy and developed economic forecasts. <p>

180,180,Associates Breakfast With Dennis Kneale,NULL,mia,"Four years ago, <i>Forbes</i> managing editor Dennis Kneale told his friends that video, not audio, was the wave of the future when it came to broadband, the Internet and entertainment. <p>

""I kept preaching, 'Wait for video,'"" he recalls saying. ""Now, the possibilities are being seen.""<p>

Kneale said he knew his view had paid off when he learned that YouTube.com, the online video-sharing web site begun only 18 months ago by two young tech entrepreneurs, sold to Google for $1.65 billion.<p>

He said we are headed into an era where you'll be able to get whatever information or entertainment you want where and when you want it &#151; something he called ""anywhere, anytime, anything.""<p>

When questioned whether this new video era is just another technology bubble that will eventually burst, Kneale said he doesn't think so based on the fact that sites like YouTube.com and MySpace.com draw millions of viewers a day &#151; real people for potential advertisers to reach. <p>

This revolution is real,"" he said. ""This value is real. You have to harness this wave.""<p>
 ""He added that when it comes to video, it looks like the movie industry has learned the lessons from the music industry, which failed in its fight against online downloading. Hollywood will partner with technology and media firms to make this new wave of entertainment delivery successful, he said.<p>

Kneale, one of the country's leading technology journalists, joined <i>Forbes</i> in late 1998 to expand its coverage of technology, media and health after a 16-year career at <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>. Since then he has overseen some of the most dramatic business stories of the new decade: the Internet boom, bust and rebuild; corporate scandals and investor fallout; the backlash against the drug industry amid drug recalls and soaring costs; the rise of Google and the capitalist revolution that is igniting China's economy &#151; and the travails of Martha Stewart.<p>

181,,"War Made New: Technology, Warfare and the Course of History – 1500 to Today",NULL,Forums,"Acclaimed author Max Boot, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, explored how innovations in weaponry and tactics have transformed warfare and guided the course of human events, from the formation of the first modern states 500 years ago to the collapse of the Soviet Union and the coming of al-Qaeda. <p>

But no matter how revolutionary the technological innovations have been &#151; be it gunpowder or laser-guided ""smart"" bombs &#151; Boot said that the most important factor is how well a country does at adapting to that new technology. <p>

""It's not enough for a country to be big and powerful,"" he said, citing the cases of Spain and the Ottoman Empire, which didn't adapt to changes as well as their adversaries. ""You have to find the best uses for these technologies."" <p>

Germany, for example, didn't have better tanks than France or England at the start of World War II. But they had a new way of thinking about war &#151; lightning-fast strikes using infantry, armor and air support together, with all of them communicating by radio. Meanwhile, France was defending with World War I-era trench warfare mentality. <p>

""The Germans could out-think their adversaries,"" Boot said. <p>

Today, America's enemies are doing the same thing. Al-Qaeda doesn't try to fight the United States in conventional ways. They use cheap, flexible tools of terrorism that are hard to defeat, he said. <p>

""Groups like Al-Qaeda are like the eBay of terrorism,"" Boot said, citing their flexibility, their ability to quickly adapt to new circumstances and their use of technology, like the Internet. ""The enemy is inside our ‘decision cycle.' They're reacting faster than we are."" <p>

Boot said to defeat terrorists, America must reform its military structure to allow soldiers in the field to respond more quickly and creatively to the situation on the ground. We also need to know more about our adversaries. We need more people who know the countries where the terrorists operate, and who speak their language. And we need to focus more on a creative, nimble military and less on the large hardware items the Pentagon loves (though those still have their important purposes). <p>

""What we really need are smart people"" who have the skills needed in this terrorism fight, Boot said. ""We need to have organizational change. This is a long-term task."" <p>

But what these issues have in common, he said, is the need for the U.S. to remain competitive with the rest of the world, which is rapidly catching up to American finance, technology and other areas of previous dominance. <p>

""What does it take to keep us competitive?"" he asked during a meeting with members of the Milken Institute Associates.""It's human capital. It's energy. It's capital markets. It's infrastructure. If we can do something about all of these things, we can say we've done something useful."" <p>

Donohue outlined some of the issues in which the chamber is heavily involved, including: <p>

<ul>
  <li> Immigration <br>
  <li> Education<br>
  <li> Capital markets <br>
  <li> Energy and global warming<br>
  <li> Infrastructure<br>
  <li> Trade<br>
  <li> Health care </li>
</ul>
<p>

The chamber has issued several detailed studies proposing solutions on many of these issues, he said. <p>

For example, he said we need to apply the efficiencies of technology, which have made America's financial markets the strongest in the world, to the growing health-care sector to keep it competitive and reduce costs. <p>

With capital markets, the chamber is urging the federal government to reform and modernize its markets regulations to ensure that the U.S. maintains its global competitive advantage. <p>

According to the Israeli Finance Ministry, the July 2006 Second Lebanese War will cost up to $5 billion. <p>

Even before the war, the Northern region had already experienced a relatively weak labor and housing market, and lower performance in commercial and industrial activities than the national average.<p>

To successfully achieve growth and development, the region requires an influx of capital. 
But traditional funding sources, such as government agencies or foreign aid, are typically insufficient or cumbersome to access, particularly for Northern Israel. Therefore, the region needs to focus on alternative funding options. <p>

As part of the Financial Innovations Lab series, the Milken Institute researched and explored several alternative financing options for facilitating recovery and growth in post-war Northern Israel. The first of these labs was held at the Milken Institute in Santa Monica.  The second was held on Sept. 15 in New York City (view summary).<p>

Participants at the first lab explored an array of financing options. Over the course of discussion, participants determined that two alternative funding options were the most feasible and pressing: development of a bond authority for infrastructure and public-private projects, and expansion of the KIEDF Small Business Revolving Loan Fund model.  <p>

Through development of a bond authority, the government and private partners can raise capital for needed infrastructure, such as expanded highways and renovated rail lines, which will bring business to Northern Israel.

A representative from the Israeli Finance Ministry stated that many existing and statutorily approved infrastructure and business finance projects remain unexecuted due to budgetary constraints.<p>

The group decided that a Northern Israel Bond Authority would generate capital to develop these promising projects for the region. Financial and legal experts suggested that the bonds may be issued by a U.S. conduit in partnership with an Israeli project sponsor.<p>

The group explored several financing options. They also determined that adding a layer of credit enhancement to any financing model would decrease risk and increase the likelihood of investment. With sufficient legal support oversight and evaluation, the implementation of the bond authority could become a reality in the coming year.<p>

Participants discussed the success of the KIEDF Revolving Loan Fund model for small-business growth. Through the fund, KIEDF puts philanthropic dollars to work in the private sector, providing small-business, micro-enterprise and microfinance loans to entrepreneurs. Because the model is already effective, little discussion on improvements or challenges occurred during this session. Rather, participants encouraged KIEDF to continue and expand its work. The group thought particular emphasis should be given to small businesses that, because of the war, currently have restricted bank accounts.<p>

Lab participants suggested that the small-business loans provided by KIEDF, and small-business loans in general, be securitized in a targeted collateralized loan obligation (CLO). A targeted Northern Israel CLO would allow KIEDF and banks to go one step further in lending, providing further liquidity in the constrained small-business credit sector. <p>

The Milken Institute's Strategic Action Volunteer Effort (SAVE), which convenes a team of highly experienced volunteers willing to take on and solve complex problems, was launched in April 2006. Its maiden project, Achieving Energy Independence, tackles the urgent issue of our dependence on fossil fuels and the consequences of climate change. <p>

On Nov. 9, 2006, the Milken Institute conducted its first Financial Innovations Lab for Achieving Energy Independence at the Bloomberg headquarters in New York City. Participants included a select group of high-level representatives from the worlds of finance and energy.<p>

The hands-on workshop sought to clarify alternative-energy investment gaps and opportunities, with a particular focus on the transportation sector and the alternative fuels and technologies available today that will help us move away from oil and petroleum. <p>

Two promising developments in the sector were given special consideration: bio-fuels and coal-to-liquid technology. Participants sought to identify and work through specific investment instruments designed to increase capital flows to the alternative-energy sector and produce financial returns.  <p>

While everyone agreed that there is an urgent need to increase investment in and accelerate adoption of alternative fuels and new technologies, much of the discussion revolved around asset and risk management in an industry that is perceived as young and uncertain.<p>

Participants debated the issues of attracting long-term investors, scalability, the mechanisms required to hedge - or insure - against volatile oil prices, and the role of government and legislation in addressing both the supply and demand sides of the alternative-energy equation.<p>

The discussion resulted in some creative financial solutions: an insurance policy against falling oil prices; green bonds and BTU-backed bonds; the creation of a fixed-income product or a futures market for alternative fuels; credit enhancement or a finance lease from the government; and, most importantly, the bifurcation of credit risk and equity risk to hedge against the long-term volatility of oil prices.",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,11,9,2006,NULL,NULL,0,NULL,New York,NULL,0,0,NULL,1,0,0,0,1,NULL,"{length = 8, bytes = 0x0000000000240eab}",NULL,NULL,NULL,2005-10-21 10:30:22.000,2005-10-21 10:30:22.000,2006-11-09 00:00:00.000,NULL,NULL,39028,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

Attendees included institutional investors, emerging-market analysts, private equity funds, corporations, foundations, rating agencies, capital aggregators and international development agencies. <p>

A robust SME sector can contribute significantly to the growth and stabilization of emerging-market economies. Expansion can generate strong returns for investors, and these firms create jobs and wealth. Additionally, they often produce solutions to a country's pressing social and environmental challenges.<p>

However, despite increasing investor interest, challenges in accessing information and mitigating risk limit the ability to tap this opportunity, attendees said. The session examined these challenges and, most importantly, generated solutions and action items that participants and others can pursue. <p>

During the day-long session, participants explored mechanisms for increasing investment in emerging-market firms. These included, among others: definition of terms related to emerging-market SME investment, increased partnerships between aggregators and investors, developing common standards for reporting, and clarification of the SME business model and value chain.<p>  

Participants worked through specific investment instruments designed to increase capital flows to SMEs and produce financial and extra-financial returns. Some highlights:<p>

<ul>
  <li> Christine Eibs Singer of E+Co, a capital aggregator investing in clean-energy enterprises, described her firm's successful blended value investment model. This model focuses on triple-bottom-line returns on investment: financial, social and environmental. She also spoke of the need for technical assistance for SMEs.<br>

<li> Andrew Gaines of Gaines Partners discussed risk mitigation strategies to combat the three ""C's"" associated with investing in emerging market SMEs: country, currency and credit risks. Using a single portal that harbors a variety of insurance tools would help investors reduce their risk.<br>

<li> Noah Beckwith of Aureos Capital described the challenges of private equity investment in the SME space. These include legal, financial and scaling constraints that make private-equity investment costly and cumbersome.  However, as the market grows, so may the tools to mitigate these constraints.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Other participants suggested various innovative tools, including creation of a SME trade association; establishment of a global currency, credit enhancement and/or technical assistance fund; increased reporting; and a shared services platform to reduce costs.  Participants also noted the importance of local partnerships, in particular citing empowerment of local banking institutions as a key to serving SMEs.<p>

Arnold Schwarzenegger signed into law AB32, which mandates the widest restrictions on carbon dioxide emissions in the nation, the focus of debate immediately shifted to how the state would implement the new law. <p>

In an effort to help sort that out, the Milken Institute hosted a workshop,""AB32 and Beyond,"" that brought together public policy leaders, heads of industry, financial executives and others to examine the implications of the legislation, particularly on the expanding carbon trading and alternative energy markets. <p>

The session, moderated by Joel Kurtzman and Glenn Yago of the Milken Institute, included a primer from Dan Skopec, undersecretary of the California Environmental Protection Agency, who has been instrumental in educating different stakeholder groups on the major features of the bill. He laid out the preliminary timeline for the implementation of AB32, emphasizing that the next few months will be crucial for the market advisory committee, which must recommend emissions-trading guidelines and design features to the state's Air Resources Board. <p>

Richard Sandor, founder and CEO of the Chicago Climate Exchange (CCX), the world's first greenhouse-emission registry, reduction and trading system, spoke about the origins of the exchange and how it will be able to help California industry comply with AB32 mandates. <p>

Jane Brunner, a councilwoman in the City of Oakland, one of the earliest government members of CCX, discussed her city's sustainability and carbon-reduction programs. Measuring and verifying the impacts of their programs were the motivations behind joining CCX, she said. <p>

Joe Pettus, a senior vice president of Safeway, explained why his company felt the need to join both CCX and the California Climate Action Registry. His company, which is one of the largest commercial users of electricity in the U.S., was motivated by the desire to know exactly when, how much and from where their energy (and hence carbon emissions) flowed. Determining their ecological footprint was important to them not only from a business standpoint but also from a reputation and stewardship standpoint. <p>

Other  panelists were Dennis Albiani, former deputy legislative secretary with the Schwarzenegger administration, who talked about the genesis of the bill; Dan Braun, director of Global Environmental Finance at Stark Investments, who provided the capital-market perspective and value propositions resulting from AB32; and Bill Marcus of Calyon Financial, a key player in domestic and international carbon-trading regimes. <p>

189,,Associates Breakfast With Gary Becker,NULL,mia,"The benefits of higher education have never been greater around the world, said Nobel laureate Gary Becker, thanks to three major developments in the past 25 years: <p>

<ul>
  <li> Technology <br>
  <li> The growth of capital <br>
  <li> Globalization </li>
</ul> <p>

Each of these areas has played a part in dramatically increasing the ""rate of return of education,"" as he put it in his address to members of the Milken Institute Associates. This growing gap in pay between those who receive a higher education and those who don't can be seen in developed and developing countries alike. <p>

In China and India, for example, education has helped lift millions of people out of poverty as they now compete for decent-wage jobs with workers from around the world. <p>

""There is a good reason why China is investing so much in education,"" Becker said. <p>

This development has led to two opposing trends, he added. First, the level of inequality around the world has declined, thanks mainly to China and India's growing economies. At the same time, inequality within individual countries has increased, with the educated raising their standards of living while many uneducated and unskilled workers remain in poverty. <p>

The challenge in the United States, he said, is how can we increase the number of young people going to college? He suggested establishing policies that would support these proven methods: <p>

<ul>
<li> Better student loan programs <br>
<li> Head Start<br>
<li> School vouchers <br>
<li> More stable families </li>

191,,Overthrow: America's Century of Regime Change from Hawaii to Iraq,NULL,Forums,"While the war in Iraq receives a great deal of attention these days, the invasion is far from unique in the annals of American history. In fact, as journalist Stephen Kinzer puts it, it's just one in a long line of examples of the United States overthrowing foreign governments it doesn't like. <p>

And based on the research for his book, <i>Overthrow: America's Century of Regime Change from Hawaii to Iraq</i>, most of the time things don't turn out well for America. While the initial invasion is usually successful, he said, ""the problem is what happens afterward."" <p>

""It's like releasing a wheel at the top of a hill,"" Kinzer told the audience at a Milken Institute Forum.""You have no idea where it will bounce or end up."" <p>

Kinzer, a former correspondent for <i>The New York Times</i>, said the U.S. overthrow of foreign governments usually has three phases: <p>

<blockquote>Phase I: The foreign government does something seen as harmful to American business based in that country, such as new taxes or regulations. </blockquote> <p>

<blockquote>Phase II: The U.S. government perceives the action as anti-American and a threat to our security, and thus deserving of a military intervention or coup. </blockquote> <p>

<blockquote>Phase III: The U.S. government then justifies the overthrow with arguments that play well with the American people, such as ""we did it to liberate the poor, suffering citizens of that country from this horrible tyrant."" </blockquote> <p>

This pattern is evident from Cuba in 1898 to Iran in 1953 to Iraq today, Kinzer said. <p>

He told the story of how Iran nationalized the oil industry after World War II. When Dwight Eisenhower became president, he was persuaded by arguments not that Iran was hurting American business interests, but that Iran was turning communist, and he agreed to back a coup. The plan succeeded, and Mohammad Reza Pahlavi (the Shah of Iran) became Iran's leader for the next 26 years. <p>

Kinzer's view is that our intervention led to repression of the Iranian people that resulted in the 1979 revolution, which installed today's anti-American Islamic regime. If we had let Iran follow its own course in the 1950s, we would, he believes, have a much friendlier government in Iran today. <p>

""How different would the Middle East look today had we followed that course?"" he asked. <p>

192,,The Sushi Economy: Globalization and the Making of a Modern Delicacy,NULL,Forums,"Sasha Issenberg has always loved sushi. But it wasn't until he started talking to people in the trade &#151; chefs, fish buyers, fishermen and others &#151; that he realized how global the enterprise was. And how different. <p>

Like many international firms, where production and distribution are key elements to success, the sushi business relies on modern technology as well a global network of suppliers and distributors. For example, fishermen with satellite dishes on their boats call in their catch so that when they land, it can get off-loaded, sold and shipped as quickly as possible to where it was going &#151; sometimes thousands of miles away. <p>

On the other hand, like many local companies, personal relationships are vital in the sushi business, he said. Local chefs have to work closely with fish distributors, and they with fishermen, to ensure their restaurants have the best fish they can get for dinner that night.<p>

The unique nature of the sushi business &#151; a global industry where personal relationships are essential &#151; got him interested in learning more, not just about the sushi industry, but about how its operations illustrated the opportunities and challenges of globalization. <p>

What he discovered, Issenberg said, is that globalization is a lot more complex than the media and policy makers sometimes make it out to be.

He also learned everything you could possible know about what goes into the sushi we all eat. And the news, he said, is good. Unlike other authors who've investigated the food industry who come away repelled by what they found, ""I came away with the opposite feeling,"" Issenberg said. <p>

The author talked about what he found during his research, which took him to five continents, meeting with everyone from tuna ""ranchers"" in Australia to chefs in the world's finest sushi restaurants. <p>

193,,Associates Breakfast With Alvin Toffler,NULL,mia,"Futurist Alvin Toffler has an analogy for what's happening in the world today. Call it the global highway. <p>

Business, says the author of such best-selling books as <i>Future Shock</i> and <i>Third Wave</i>, is like a car traveling 100 mph down that highway. It's moving faster than anyone else. Behind it are other institutions, like the American family, which is traveling at around 60 mph &#151; not quite keeping up with the fast pace of business, but still changing relatively quickly with the times. <p>

Then there are unions, which are going about  30 mph, followed by government at about 25 mph. Bringing up the rear, he says, is America's K-12 education system, which in his analogy is traveling at about 10 mph &#151; and getting further and further behind. <p>

""How can you run a knowledge-based economy where business operates at 100 mph with an education system changing at 10 mph?"" Toffler asked in a meeting with members of the Milken Institute Associates.""We have to change the system, not just try and make this one work."" <p>

In Toffler's mind, bureaucracies are getting more and more out of synch with the rest of society &#151; to the point where serious problems, like the government's response to Hurricane Katrina, will become more and more the norm. <p>

Other comments: <p>

  <li> In today's political debate, no one talks about the fact that we have changed to a knowledge-based economy. <br>
<li> We live in an era of extraordinary change, and there will be conflict.<br>
<li> With the rapid developments in technology, biotechnology and nanotechnology, we are headed for a gigantic battle 30 to 50 years from now over how you define a human being. This will create a moral struggle. </li>

194,,Associates Breakfast With Steven Chu,NULL,mia,"Steven Chu is one of the world's leading experts on climate change. And he doesn't mince his words. <p>

Due to changes in climate, which scientists now believe is almost certainly caused by humans, we face significant dangers from a warming planet, including: <p>

<ul>
  <li> Increased damage from storms, floods and wildfires <br>
<li> Property losses and population displacement from rises in sea levels<br>
<li> Changes in the productivity of farms, forests and fisheries<br>
<li> Increased species extinction<br>
<li> Spread of diseases <br>
<li> Water shortages</li>
</ul> <p>

Fortunately, said Chu, winner of the Nobel Prize in physics and director of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in Berkeley, many smart people are working on the problem &#151; and there are many potential solutions. <p>

The fight, he said, should focus on two areas: <p>

1)	Maximizing energy efficiency and minimizing energy use; and<br>
2)	Developing new sources of clean energy<p>

As for the first, regulation can plan an important role, helping spur industry innovation, he said. A good example is the average American refrigerator, which in the mid-1970s measured 18 cubic feet, cost $1,270 and used 1,800 kilowatt hours per year. Today, more than two decades after California and the federal government imposed energy efficiency standards, the average refrigerator is bigger at 22 cubic feet, cheaper at less than $500 and more energy efficient, using less than 600 kWh per year. <p>

On the alternative energy side, scientists and others are working on a number of promising technologies that could make solar, wind, biofuels and other sources cheaper and more efficient. He showed Associates some of the work going on in these areas, including the use of grasses and cellulose as future source of energy.<p>

195,,AB 32 and Beyond: A Laboratory in the Next Steps in California's Policy on Global Warming,NULL,Forums,"When Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger signed into law AB32, which mandates the widest restrictions on carbon dioxide emissions in the nation, the focus of debate immediately shifted to how the state would implement the new law. <p>

In an effort to help sort that out, the Milken Institute hosted a workshop, ""AB32 and Beyond,"" that brought together public policy leaders, heads of industry, financial executives and others to examine the implications of the legislation, particularly on the expanding carbon trading and alternative energy markets. <p>

The session, moderated by Joel Kurtzman and Glenn Yago of the Milken Institute, included a primer from Dan Skopec, undersecretary of the California Environmental Protection Agency, who has been instrumental in educating different stakeholder groups on the major features of the bill. He laid out the preliminary timeline for the implementation of AB32, emphasizing that the next few months will be crucial for the market advisory committee, which must recommend emissions-trading guidelines and design features to the state's Air Resources Board. <p>

Richard Sandor, founder and CEO of the Chicago Climate Exchange (CCX), the world's first greenhouse-emission registry, reduction and trading system, spoke about the origins of the exchange and how it will be able to help California industry comply with AB32 mandates. <p>

Jane Brunner, a councilwoman in the City of Oakland, one of the earliest government members of CCX, discussed her city's sustainability and carbon-reduction programs. Measuring and verifying the impacts of their programs were the motivations behind joining CCX, she said. <p>

Joe Pettus, a senior vice president of Safeway, explained why his company felt the need to join both CCX and the California Climate Action Registry. His company, which is one of the largest commercial users of electricity in the U.S., was motivated by the desire to know exactly when, how much and from where their energy (and hence carbon emissions) flowed. Determining their ecological footprint was important to them not only from a business standpoint but also from a reputation and stewardship standpoint. <p>

Other  panelists were Dennis Albiani, former deputy legislative secretary with the Schwarzenegger administration, who talked about the genesis of the bill; Dan Braun, director of Global Environmental Finance at Stark Investments, who provided the capital-market perspective and value propositions resulting from AB32; and Bill Marcus of Calyon Financial, a key player in domestic and international carbon-trading regimes. <p>

Participants realized that every move California makes in this area will be closely scrutinized, and therefore, careful planning and consideration of complex economic and social issues cannot be overlooked, they agreed. <p>

198,,Associates Breakfast With John Bruton,NULL,mia,"Former Irish Prime Minister John Bruton, fresh off a visit with Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, said that too many Americans and Californians take Europe for granted, but shouldn't, since it remains one of our most important trading partners. <p>

""We Europeans own a lot of you, and you own a lot of us,"" said Bruton, the European Union ambassador to the United States. ""What's good for you is good for us, and what's bad for you is bad for us."" <p>

During a private visit to the Milken Institute, Bruton met with members of the Milken Institute Associates and representatives of several European consulates based in Los Angeles. The wide-ranging discussion touched on everything from trade and energy to Turkey and violence in the Middle East. <p>

Bruton, who while prime minister from 1994 to 1997 was deeply involved in the Northern Irish Peace Process, said he wished the United States would use some of the lessons he learned while helping end Northern Ireland's sectarian violence on the current situation in the Middle East. One of those is the willingness to talk to the bad guys. <p>

""If we had said, 'We won't talk to them until they recognize our right to exist,' we wouldn't have talked,"" and the 1998 Good Friday Agreement would never have been signed, Bruton said. <p>

Other topics he touched on: <p>

<ul>
  <li> The two issues affecting Europe that concern him most are 1) a lack of its sources of energy, and 2) a declining birth rate.
<li> He believes Turkey will eventually be accepted into the EU, but that it will take much more time than many believe.
<li> The lack of functioning governments in Africa are the root of it problems.
<li> European leaders need to do a better job at creating ways to make people feel more European. (""We need to create more of a sense of 'we' in Europe."") </li>
</ul>

Bruton's talk is one of a series of meetings with global and national leaders of distinction hosted at the Institute for its Associates.

  <li> China imports more goods every day than it did for the entire year of 1978.
<li> India graduates twice as many college students as the United States.
<li> Three out of every four toys made in the world today are manufactured in China.</li>
</ul>
<p>

The story, of course, is the astronomical rise of China and India as global powerhouses and the impact this will have on nations and workers around the world &#151; what journalist Robyn Meredith calls a ""tectonic"" shift in global economics.<p>

Her warning: The developed world better get ready to accept and respond to major disruptions in workforces, geopolitics, economics and many other areas as a result of the rise of China and India.<p>

""The new global job market is worrying the West &#151; and it should,"" said Meredith, an editor for <i>Forbes</i> magazine based in Hong Kong and author of a new book about India and China, <i>The Elephant and the Dragon</i>. ""Westerners can no longer expect to earn ten times everyone else for the same work.""<p>

She emphasized, however, that not all of these changes should be feared.<p>

For example, millions of people in India and China have been lifted out of poverty in recent years, which also provides a new source of exports for the developed world. And the ability of U.S. companies to manufacture goods overseas means lower prices for American consumers. That helps our economy.<p>

""India and China are both friends and foes,"" she said. ""We must adapt because these changes are inevitable. And we wouldn't want to stop it even if we could.""<p>

America in particular, she said, must respond aggressively to the new competitive realities.<p>
 
First, we must recognize that job losses are inevitable and create resources to help people deal with job loss, such as better retraining programs, she said. Second, we must improve our K-12 education system.<p>

200,,HOW: Why HOW We Do Anything Means Everything...in Business (and in Life),NULL,Forums,"The most successful businesses, says Dov Seidman, used to be the creators of the best products. The world has changed, however, and today, success is starting to go to those who create the best <i>experience</i> customers have with a firm and its products &#151; the <i>how</i> of running a business, he calls it. <p>

""The only thing we can control is how we run things,"" says Seidman, author of <i>HOW: Why HOW We Do Anything Means Everything...in Business (and in Life)</i>. ""Yes, you need great stuff, but it doesn't even the game &#151; it just keeps you <i>in</i> the game."" <p>

It's relatively easy to copy someone else's product today, but creating a positive, unique experience for customers is harder to do. How you ""out-behave"" your competition, how you conduct yourself, is what sets firms apart today, he says. <p>

""In a world in which nothing stays hidden, we must act as if we have nothing to hide,"" he says. ""Information today is like a toddler &#151; it goes everywhere and can't be controlled."" <p>

Acting ethically and responsibly toward your customers, shareholders and employees is vital. And this takes an inspired work force that operates in an atmosphere of trust and integrity, Seidman says. As his research has shown, high-trust in the workplace leads to more business. <p>

""Differentiate between what you have a right to do, and what is right to do,"" he says. <p>

Seidman, founder, chairman and CEO of LRN, a leading provider of business ethics solutions, has been preaching this competitive mantra for more than a decade. It has caught the attention of some of our most astute observers, including <I>New York Times</i> columnist Thomas Friedman, author of <i>The World Is Flat</i>, who has quoted him numerous times. <p>

203,203,Catastrophic Risk: Cat Bonds and Beyond,NULL,finlabs,"The increasing incidence of disaster -- from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita to tsunamis and earthquakes -- has highlighted the need for catastrophe protection and insurance for individuals, communities and companies.<p>
In response, the Milken Institute hosted a ""Financial Innovations Lab for Catastrophic Risk: Cat Bonds and Beyond"" on October 25, 2007, at the Metropolitan Club in New York City. The Lab focused on identifying and analyzing capital market solutions for financing catastrophic risk management.<p> 
Participants included insurance professionals, investment bankers, academics, lawyers, rating agencies and risk-modeling experts, as well as other experts from the insurance and capital markets. The goal of the Lab was to identify obstacles to the expansion of the market for catastrophe (cat) bonds and risk-linked securities, and to develop strategies to tackle those barriers.<p>
The agenda identified four primary barriers that translated into four sessions featuring presentations, case studies and the lively participation of the 48 participants. At the start of the day, Markus Schmutz from Swiss Re provided an industry overview of risk-linked securities. Schmutz noted that the market for catastrophe bonds has grown substantially, from around US $700 million in 1997 to approximately US $13.5 billion outstanding at the moment. He also outlined the benefits of cat bonds -- such as full collateralization and multi-year pricing of contracts -- as attractive alternative sources of capital.<p>
The first identified barrier dealt with limits in the secondary market and concerns about liquidity. Gerald Ouderkirk of Goldman Sachs and Albert Selius of Swiss Re, who both head trading desks for cat bonds, described the market for the bonds as liquid and pointed to the lack of issuances as one of the barriers of expansion. Selius provided an overview of exchange-traded instruments and recent developments on derivative exchanges, which are currently active in catastrophic risk trading. Ouderkirk noted that hedge funds were the primary participants in the secondary market space over the past 12 months.<p>
One session was dedicated to the role and perspective of investors in the cat bond market. Eric Silvergold of Guggenheim Partners explained that despite the attractiveness of these bonds (including low correlation with other asset classes), fixed-income investors typically do not have the economics to invest in them. There is a need, he said, to democratize access to risk-assessing tools.<p>
Rating agencies play a crucial role in the issuance of risk-linked securities, Rodrigo Araya of Moody's noted that they can help develop the market lies by educating investors and offering sponsors a clear and reasonable rating approach.<p>
Another session dealt with transaction costs. Jeff Cooper of Allstate Insurance Company highlighted the many hesitations insurers have in becoming buyers of cat bond coverage. Cooper estimated that currently the transaction costs for cat bonds run at approximately 20 percent higher than for typical reinsurance contracts. However, Michael Millette from Goldman Sachs pointed out that the higher transaction costs result from the novelty of capital market insurance solutions and said he expects them to decline substantially.<p>
The final session of the day addressed the importance of public-private partnerships in tackling the challenges of providing risk coverage to communities and nations. Stuart Miller of AIR Worldwide gave a presentation on an innovative issuance by the Government of Mexico, which placed the first sovereign cat bond in history to provide funding for emergency losses in the aftermath of an earthquake in Mexico City.<p>

The Milken Institute hosted a forum with health-care, business and public-policy leaders to talk about the Institute's groundbreaking report, <i>An Unhealthy America: The Economic Burden of Chronic Disease</i>. <p>

The day included a briefing on the study by lead author Ross DeVol, director of the Milken Institute's Center for Health Economics, a keynote talk by Institute Chairman Michael Milken and two panel discussions focused on what business and government can do to lessen the burden of chronic disease. <p>

DeVol and Milken both acknowledged the tremendous human costs of chronic disease, but pointed out that this study's focus is on the often-overlooked costs to business and the U.S. economy. <p>

""The rising rates of chronic disease are largely ignored, but are a very large contributor to the rising growth of health-care costs in this country,"" said DeVol. ""Lost productivity vastly exceeds the direct treatment costs. And because employers still cover the majority of health-care costs in this country, it is a hidden burden on them as well as the employees and their families."" <p>

Milken said most of these costs are avoidable since they are lifestyle-related, and that we need to ""contain the containable"" by lowering our weight, eating better, getting exercise and not smoking. <p>

""It's our position that we could substantially provide high-quality care for all Americans if we were not burdened by the costs of an unhealthy America and the cost of chronic disease,"" Milken said. ""Good health is an investment in economic growth."" <p>

The first panel of the day, ""The Carrot or the Stick: How Can Businesses Encourage Their Employees to Lead Healthier Lives?"" focused on what businesses can do to encourage healthier living by their employees. Moderated by Milken, the panel consisted of Lance Lang, M.D., Vice President and Senior Medical Director of Quality Improvement and Medical Informatics, at Health Net of California; Ken Shachmut, Senior Vice President of Safeway; and Jackie Trask, Vice President, Human Resources Worldwide, at Jafra Cosmetics International, Inc. <p>

Shachmut told the audience that his company focuses heavily on the health of its employees because it's not only important to its workers, but it will bring down skyrocketing health-care costs. <p>

""If we can identify those areas that can be controlled and prevented, give people personal financial incentives to make choices that lead them in that direction, we believe we can cut an enormous amount out of our current health-care bill,"" he said. <p>

The second panel, ""If a Healthy America Is So Important to Our Future, What Should Policy Leaders Be Doing to Lead the Way?"" looked at government's role in reducing chronic disease. Moderated by Margaret Anderson, Chief Operating Officer of <i>FasterCures / The Center for Accelerating Medical Solutions</i>, the panel consisted of Sophia Chang, Director, Better Chronic Disease Care program, at the California Healthcare Foundation; former California Gov. Gray Davis; and Dean Rosen, Partner at Mehlman Vogel Castagnetti and the former chief health-care advisor to Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist. <p>

All agreed that many obstacles prevent government from moving more quickly in this area, but that progress is being made as policy leaders realize the importance of prevention as a tool to fight rising health-care costs. <p>

""We don't spend a lot of time or energy focusing on nutrition,"" said Davis. ""We need to reorder our priorities, spend money on prevention, have an education program reinforcing individuals making good choices and you'll find a lot less money having to be spent on the back end."" <p>

The forum was one of two held on the study. The other was hosted by the New England Healthcare Institute in Boston on Oct. 17, 2007.

She serves on the board of Teach for America and the American Association for Cancer Research; she is a regent of the University of California and chairs the University Health Services Committee. She also serves on Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger's Committee on Education Excellence and was appointed to the Independent Citizens' Oversight Committee of the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine.<p>

When asked about the differences in her past and current endeavors, Lansing confessed that she&prime;s had to adjust to a new reality. In her former life, she could draw on the immense human, physical and capital resources of a major studio -- now she's making do with less and taking on complex tasks with a barebones staff. This resource challenge is reflected in the pace of foundation work, which can be excruciatingly slow, she said, compared to the breakneck speed and relentless deadlines that defined her previous role. <p>

""I underestimated the amount of patience you need to get things done,"" said Lansing. ""The foundation world doesn't have the same sense of urgency -- it is easy for momentum to get lost.""<p>

Yet there are also striking similarities between Lansing's corporate career and her latest endeavors. ""I actually bring a bit of naivet&eacute; to the job. I don't balk when I meet resistance. I'm not afraid to say things or get my hands dirty.""<p>

The Sherry Lansing Foundation may not be large, but given Lansing's skills at building coalitions of people who bring different resources and talents to the table, she has the building blocks to pursue her vision of a better world with great success.

Economics for emotional people might sound like that gut course you were looking for senior year in college, but Tyler Cowan has capitalized on his self-proclaimed ""screwy version of economics"" to address everything from how to fall in love to how to visit an art museum.  Tailoring his methodology for the Milken Institute audience, he unleashed his inner policy economist to analyze some of the nation's policy challenges.<p>
 
Understanding our emotional limitations, such as the tendency to approach small probabilities by either ignoring them or over-inflating them, has particular resonance in the politics around addressing climate change.  Any dramatic shift in outcome requires a political mechanism that could overcome the emotional issues and focus on examining what kind of insurance we, as a nation, are willing to purchase to avoid the worst-case scenario.  <p>

Income tax policy is another emotionally-laden issue, although it is always presented in the guise of rational numbers.  The current focus on wage disparity and the efforts to tax high-wage earners is less linked to the real issue &#151; the burgeoning unfunded liabilities of Medicare and social security &#151; than it is to the emotional sense of what is ""fair.""  Unfortunately, human emotions perceive ""fairness"" at 50/50, a tax level at which most workers would probably not continue to work.  This would, in turn, severely undermine any effort to get workers to stay in the workforce for the additional few years that would help fund the benefits. <p>

To keep that aging workforce healthy, however, comes with its own set of emotional economics.  Research shows that although Americans are spending more on healthcare, they aren't deriving much benefit from the increase in spending.  Yet, more than any other area, this is a cost item that is very hard to say no to, particularly when it involves another family member and there is a third party payment.  We just keep saying yes to more procedures, more tests, and more costs.  This may feed our emotional need to feel good about taking care of our health, but does little to obtain an actual healthier outcome.<p>

According to Cowen, approaching key policy issues through emotional economics provides a better understanding of the hurdles that must be broached prior to developing any sort of acceptable solution to voters and to our national conscience.<p>

And as Joel Kurtzman and Glenn Yago of the Milken Institute stated in their talk, companies doing business in other countries must understand these factors if they hope to succeed. <p>

To help, Kurtzman and Yago have created two important tools that will help companies identify and deal with global risks: <p>

<ul>
  <li> Their CLEAR framework explains the potentially expensive challenges businesses face overseas: Corruption, the Legal system, Enforcement policy, Accounting standards and governance, and Regulatory developments. <br>

<li> Their Opacity Index measures how countries are ranked relative to each CLEAR factor, so companies can balance their exposure. </li>
</ul>
<p>

""Knowledge is a key driver in the global economy,"" said Yago, director of Capital Studies at the Milken Institute. ""Its distribution is an important factor in economic growth."" <p>

Kurtzman, a senior fellow at the Institute, said the amount of data they have made available makes clear that the real risks to business are not the large-scale, infrequent risks, such as terrorist attacks or earthquakes, but the small-scale, high-frequency risks such as corruption or a lack of a strong legal system. <p>

""The small-scale, high-frequency risks are the most expensive risks for businesses,"" said Kurtzman. <p>

According to the authors' Opacity Index, the countries with the highest scores are Finland, the United Kingdom and Denmark (the United States is sixth). Those with the lowest scores are Indonesia, Lebanon and Venezuela. In other words, those at the top of the Index pose the least risk to businesses, while those at the bottom the greatest number of risks. <p>

With that simple understanding, Yunus has helped millions of poor people in his native Bangladesh by creating a bank that loans them small sums of money to start businesses and improve their standards of living. <p>

His efforts earned him the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006, the first ever awarded to an economist. <p>

In a talk at the Milken Institute with Chairman Michael Milken, Yunus described how the simple idea of giving even the poorest person access to capital as a means of empowering them grew into the Grameen Bank, which today has 2,500 branches and services in more than 79,000 villages throughout Bangladesh, as well as 7.3 million borrowers, 97 percent of whom are women. <p>

He and Milken agreed that improving entrepreneurs' access to capital is one of the most important tools available for economic development worldwide. <p>

""Two-thirds of the world's population have no access to financial institutions,"" Yunus said. ""And in a world where you need a dollar to make a dollar, they never get that first dollar."" <p>

Milken called access to capital the key to prosperity. <p>

""Investing in small and medium-sized businesses will bring prosperity to every part of our planet,"" he said. <p>

Yunus said one reason the Grameen Bank has succeeded (and it does make money, he pointed out) is that mainstream financial institutions didn't view it as a threat, since they lent money to people deemed not credit-worthy. <p>

As a result, Grameen Bank was able to create business people out of individuals as diverse as beggars and housewives. (One company offshoot, Grameenphone, has 16 millions subscribers in Bangladesh today, thanks in part to the many ""telephone ladies"" who rent their phones to other villagers for calls.)

211,,Who Killed Health Care?,NULL,Forums,"When it comes to buying a car or a house, Americans have plenty of information and plenty of choices. <p>

Yet when it comes to health care, information and choices remain in short supply, and that's a major reason our system is in such trouble, said Regina Herzlinger of Harvard Business School.<p>

Fortunately, under growing pressure from both employers and employees, reform of the nation's health-care system is imminent, she predicted during a talk Monday at the Milken Institute. <p>

""We're at a tipping point,"" she said. ""We're going to have profound change very soon.""<p>

Herzlinger addressed the development of the U.S. health-care system; what has been done to try to improve it; and what she feels is the best way to unravel the mess: a consumer-oriented, market-driven system in which users, not providers, make decisions about the health care they want. She calls this a ""let the flowers bloom"" system.<p>

In answer to the question that is the title of her book, ""Who Killed Health Care?"" she pointed to three culprits: insurance companies, the government and hospitals, whose profit-making or political motives affect their decisions on patient care.<p>

The current system, bloated with bureaucracy and one-size-fits-all rules, has increased costs and illness rather than reduced them, she said. Consumers don't have the incentives to stay healthy that would exist in a system where they have choices and are rewarded for healthier lifestyles.<p>

Giving consumers the power to make their own decisions on how much and what kind of insurance to buy, and giving them performance evaluations of doctors and hospitals, would produce a more equitable, less costly and better system, Herzlinger said. It would also help take the onus off the back of employers, who often don't know what their workers want in terms of health care.<p>

""Would you want your employer to buy your car or your home?"" she asked. ""Of course you wouldn't. They don't know what you want. So why are they buying your health insurance?""<p>

214,,Achieving Energy Independence,NULL,finlabs,"The Milken Institute conducted its third Financial Innovations Lab for Achieving Energy Independence on Tuesday, October 23, 2007, at the Metropolitan Club in New York. The purpose of the Lab was to address the real state of the art with regard to alternative energy.<p>
The Milken Institute's Financial Innovation Labs are proprietary research tools that bring together researchers, policy-makers, and business, financial and professional practitioners to create market-based solutions to business and public-policy challenges.<p> Participants in this Lab included members of SAVE, the Strategic Action Volunteer Effort, inaugurated by Michael Milken in April 2006, to bring together volunteer teams adept at deploying state-of-the-art financial technologies and capital-market solutions to tackle particular issues. Those attending also included leading scientists and technologists from Sandia National Laboratories, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, the California Institute of Technology and Stanford University.<p>
The goal of the working session was not to provide answers about technologies to a group of capital market leaders, said Ron Stoltz, Head of the California Liaison Office of Sandia National Labs, at the start of the day. Rather it was to provide the informational context that would lead to better questions.<p>
Professor Arnulf Grubler of Yale University and a lead author of several studies by the Nobel-Prize winning Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, introduced a term that reappeared throughout the day: ""timescales."" The IPCC climate-change scenarios, and the history of previous large-scale changes in energy supply, point to timescales of 30, 70 and 100 years, he said. Within this long-term framework, government policies and fluctuations in prices play an insignificant role in the climate and technology outcomes.<p>
 The key driver of outcomes is demand, as experienced through end-use applications, he said. For example, Thomas Edison invented the light bulb and then started an electric company to supply its power. That power company built its delivery systems around alternating current (AC) electricity, rather than the direct current (DC) system prevalent at the time, because AC is a better fit for the light bulb -- the end-use application.<p>
An important finding in Grubler's research, he explained, is that markets select dominant technology clusters based of end-use requirements. This insight leads to a new and different set of questions for both policy analysts and capital market participants, he said.<p>
So what is the potential for renewable energy? Dan Arvizu, Director of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, recalled being asked this question in Washington, D.C., at a meeting with political leaders. Using transportation fuels as an example, he replied that the United States could achieve energy independence quickly if it relied in equal parts on domestic oil, biofuels and higher fuel efficiency.<p>
That answer illustrated an important insight of the day: carbon reduction is not a single-technology solution, but a combination of current and new technologies and greater energy efficiency.<p>
Two gaps persist in the renewables landscape, said Arvizu: delivery of renewable technologies at less than $30 per barrel and investment in energy efficiency. One example of the latter is the zero-energy home, which he characterized as a low-hanging fruit.<p>
Terry Michalske, Director of Biological and Energy Sciences at Sandia National Laboratories, provided a nuanced road map on biofuels. Moving the discussion beyond the use of ethanol, he suggested a broad scope of use and an important role for biofuels in an economic transition to reduced carbon emissions. The optimal sources of cellulose vary significantly across the varied climates of the United States, he said. Each source requires a tailored biological process for conversion efficiency, and thus a different infrastructure (production facilities, distribution systems, and auto fuel systems). He added that biofuels do release carbon and that as the U.S. economy becomes more carbon-efficient, it is expected that their use will decline. Michalske also pointed out that the emerging biofuels industry has yet to take advantage of the bountiful tool set developed in the biotech industry, and its adoption will greatly enrich and speed biofuel development.<p>
Franklin Orr, who directs the Global Climate and Energy Project at Stanford University, reinforced two frequent themes of the day: the enormous scale of the climate change problem (and consequently its solution) and the need for a portfolio of technologies. To illustrate the magnitude of the challenge, he explained that for carbon sequestration alone, the country would need a new infrastructure 40 percent the size of the infrastructure developed for the global oil industry.<p>
Sequestration in geological cavities created by oil and gas extraction is possible in the near-term, said Orr, adding that at current rates, there is capacity for 10 years of emissions. More research is needed for sequestration in saline aquifers and the cavities created by coal extraction, but they have a 100-year capacity. Carbon, once emitted, remains in the atmosphere for about 300 years before sinking into the ocean, so carbon capture at the point of emission is needed. (Further, it is more expensive to extract carbon from the atmosphere, and carbon-intense oceans are profoundly harmful to our marine ecosystem, he warned.) Consequently, new coal plants must be sited close to the geological opportunities for sequestration. The United States has abundant geological capacity for sequestration, he said, but China does not, again suggesting that there is no single technology solution for carbon emissions from coal power plants.<p>
But what if carbon emissions could be transformed from a ""bad"" to a ""good""? Andrew McIlroy of Sandia National Labs, used the example of algae for biofuels. Carbon is a nutrient for algae growth, he said, and there are R&D projects focused on the opportunity to take carbon out of the air to use to feed the organic material used to make biofuel. Another example is the use of CO2 for enhanced oil and gas extraction, with a current price of $50 per ton.<p>
McIlroy also identified opportunities in non-carbon greenhouse gases, each hundreds and thousands of times more harmful to the climate than carbon. These gases are emitted in smaller quantities than carbon, but because of their concentrated impact, the right incentives could make a big difference in emissions. He also noted that carbon credits or the $25 million Earth Challenge Prize offered by Richard Branson could motivate breakthrough streams of research.<p>

Its goal is to make the successful development of children the nation's top economic priority. PAES is managed and partially funded by The Pew Charitable Trusts. <p> 

The day included a panel of researchers, who presented new studies on the economic benefit of investing in early childhood; a panel of business leaders, who discussed the benefits and challenges of business engagement in this policy area; a keynote address by Milken Institute Chairman Michael Milken; a policy-maker discussion with the lieutenant governor of Colorado, Barbara O'Brien; and a facilitated audience discussion on ways to move forward. <p>

The day's first panel, ""New Data on the Economic Benefits of Investments in Children,"" featured four researchers, who presented new evidence on the economic impacts of early childhood investment. Moderated by Sara Watson, Senior Officer at The Pew Charitable Trusts and Director of PAES, the panel consisted of Professor Greg Duncan of Northwestern University, Professor Timothy Bartik of the Upjohn Institute, Professor William Dickens of the University of Maryland and Professor Bernard Guyer of Johns Hopkins University. <p>

Duncan addressed the economic benefits of raising family income during the earliest years. He found that raising poor families' incomes to or above the poverty line has substantial economic benefits for both the family and society, including increasing children's future earnings as adults and reducing their dependence on welfare and food stamps. <p>

Bartik explained how early childhood programs contribute to job growth and economic development, even more so than business subsidies, a mechanism traditionally used for state economic development. High-quality early childhood programs increase jobs to a greater degree than business subsidies over the long-term, he said, and from a national perspective, they provide earnings effects at least three times greater than business subsidies. <p>

Dickens also addressed the value of implementing a high-quality early childhood program nationwide and projected that if the studied program were implemented at full scale, it would increase the stock of physical and human capital, GDP and revenues at all levels of government to a greater degree than having no program at all. Specifically, he projected that 75 years after its implementation, savings and increased revenue from the program would exceed its costs by $88 billion. <p>

Finally, Guyer described his findings based on a review of studies on early childhood health problems (such as exposure to tobacco smoke, unintentional injury, mental health problems and obesity). His results showed that because not treating these conditions has a large adverse effect on society, investing in early childhood health is clearly cost-effective. <p>

Next, Barry Munitz, Chair of California's P-16 Council, gave an overview of the council's recommendations to date. These include expanded access to high-quality pre-K programs statewide, especially to students from low-income communities, students of color, English learners and other underrepresented students. He reasserted the value of starting early to closing the achievement gap. <p>

<p>The keynote speaker, Mike Milken, made a powerful case for investing in human capital. The global economy has dramatically changed, he said, with developing countries growing faster in recent years than industrialized nations. To keep up in an ever more competitive environment, countries must invest heavily in education and health to boost human capital.  As an example, Milken compared Singapore and Jamaica in 1960 and again in 2007. In 1960 the countries had the same per capita GDP; in 2007, Singapore, which invested much more in its human capital in the intervening years, had a per capita GDP nine times greater than Jamaica's. Today, the U.S. is falling behind in this measure. For instance, while the US spends $3,900 per child on early childhood education, China, which is projected to be the world's largest economy by 2050, spends $6,000-$10,000. 

<p>

Following the keynote address, Betsy Zeidman, Research Fellow and Director of the Center for Emerging Domestic Markets at the Institute, moderated a business panel, ""Business Leadership to Advance Investments in Children as an Economic Strategy."" The panel included Richard Atlas, Founder and CEO of The Atlas Family Foundation and former General Partner at Goldman Sachs and Co.; Dave Curry, President of Kiwanis International; Lenny Mendonca, Chairman of McKinsey Global Institute; and Jim Wunderman, President and CEO of the Bay Area Council. <p>

The business leaders discussed the role of business in advancing early childhood policies. Mendonca likened this policy debate to climate change. Several years ago, few business leaders espoused climate change as a policy in which businesses should involve themselves. Nowadays, businesses are clamoring to be ""green."" Wunderman described a study the Bay Area Council is sponsoring on local early childhood investment. The study is important, he explained, not only as a way to collect more evidence, but as a means to communicate the problem and the need to the business community. <p>

During lunch, Ted Lempert, President of Children Now, engaged Barbara O'Brien, Colorado's Lieutenant Governor, in a discussion of the value of investing in children from the state perspective. A leading policy-maker in the area of early childhood, O'Brien spoke of one of Colorado's successes, Smart Start Colorado, which was launched in 2005 as an integrated system of early childhood supports and services for children birth to age 8 and their families. She also cited various challenges facing early childhood investment in a policy environment. <p>

Finally, Robert Dugger, Managing Director at Tudor Investment Corporation and Advisory Board Chair of the Partnership for America's Economic Success, facilitated a discussion on the Telluride Principles, which were created to provide business, nonprofit and government leaders a common set of priorities within which to hold effective discussions. Through an interactive discussion, audience members discussed ways they believed the information presented during the day could be used to move children's investments forward.",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,2,28,2008,NULL,NULL,0,NULL,NULL,NULL,1,0,NULL,1,0,0,0,1,Atlas_Mendoca_pew.jpg,"{length = 8, bytes = 0x0000000000240ec5}",NULL,NULL,NULL,2005-10-21 10:30:22.000,2005-10-21 10:30:22.000,2008-02-28 00:00:00.000,NULL,NULL,39504,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

As U.S. ambassador to the Republic of Macedonia, he successfully implemented the Ohrid Peace Agreement that ended that country's internal conflict. <p>

And while on the White House National Security Council staff, he was directly involved in achieving the ""Good Friday"" Northern Ireland peace agreement. <p>

So when he was selected as one of the U.S. State Department's leading diplomats focused on Iraq earlier this year, he was clearly no stranger to crisis management. But even with all his skills and experience, no one had ever had to manage a conflict as complex as Iraq, he said in a meeting with Milken Institute Associates. <p>

With sectarian violence, al-Qaida, foreign government influence, internal political fighting and much more, it has been a slow and difficult process to push Iraq toward stability and democracy. <p>

Fortunately, Butler said, the ""surge"" in troops that began earlier this year, along with the reconstruction and political reconciliation tactics that have accompanied the military buildup, has helped reduce violence in the country. <p>

""The violence is down to levels we haven't experienced since 2005,"" he said. This has allowed important progress to be made in many parts of Iraq, he added. <p>

But while the military surge has been a success, the Iraqi national government is still a work in process, Butler conceded. <p>

After his opening remarks, Butler took questions from the Associates that ranged from concerns about Iran and Syria to reconstruction efforts. <p>

As if being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize weren&prime;t enough, Muhammad Yunus has set his sights on a new goal: turning the entire current cannon of business thought on its head. As captured in his latest book, <i>Creating a World Without Poverty</i>, Yunus is determined to bring about a tremendous change in our current understanding of what it really means to turn a profit. 
<p>

Speaking to a standing-room-only crowd at the Milken Institute, he outlined his past innovations in micro-credit &#151; which have provided the poorest citizens of Bangladesh with previously unheard-of access to credit, breaking the cycle of poverty for thousands of families in rural and urban areas alike. <p>
Building on the lessons and successes of Grameen Bank and Grameenphone (for more on this, see <a href=""/events/events.taf?function=detail&ID=210&cat=Forums"">Muhammad Yunus and Mike Milken: A Conversation</a>), Yunus is now turning his attention to the development of &quot;social businesses&quot; &#151; a revolutionary concept that measures return on investment in social outcomes rather than financial gain. Such outcomes might include the number of children with improved health, the gallons of potable water delivered to regions with unsafe water supplies, or the kilowatts of energy powering a village that previously had no electricity.   <p>

According to Yunus, current economic and financial philosophy misses the entirety and the potential of human beings.<p>

&quot;Economics has discarded everything that makes humans interesting,&quot; he said. &quot;Human beings are much bigger than money machines.&quot; <p>
While the profit motive is part of the picture, the fundamental desire to do good has been overlooked by academics and practitioners alike. Yunus insists that this impulse has a place in economics&mdash;and he characterizes the missing piece of the puzzle as &quot;non-loss, non-dividend companies.&quot;  <p>

Funding a social business is not like donating to charity. Yunus believes that social business investors can and should expect to recover their initial outlay. The return on that investment, however, will not be a financial dividend, but a tangible social benefit. The business still has the imperative to be successful in order to repay its initial investors and to grow the operation, but its ultimate success will be measured by how well it achieves its stated social objective. As an additional benefit, the recouped initial investment can be recycled into new social businesses over and over.<p>

Yunus pointed to a successful social business that is already up and running: a venture established by Grameen Bank and Dannone. The company produces an affordable yogurt enriched with nutrients that are desperately needed by impoverished children in Bangladesh. Grameen Bank and Dannone will be able to recover their investment in the enterprise, but both seek a rate of return measured in healthier children, not as a percentage of profits.  While there is no direct profit from this endeavor, Yunus commented on the incredible public relations boost for Dannone since the project&prime;s inception. <p>

Additional markets ripe for the social business model include clean water, housing, vaccines and energy. Yunus noted that there is a tremendous energy shortage in rural Bangladesh; 70 percent of the population has no access to electricity. At the Milken Institute Forum, he challenged his audience to develop a solar panel that could be sell for $1.50, as opposed to the current price of $3.00. Unlike many other technologies, solar panels have not seen a price drop. &quot;This technology is stuck,&quot; observed Yunus. <p>

Nevertheless, solar panels represent a tremendous opportunity for launching a social business. Yunus promises that if a company out there can figure out how to provide the product at the lower price, he will put solar panels in every home in Bangladesh. This would not only improve the lives of 70 percent of the Bangladeshi population&mdash;but do it with a clean, renewable energy source. <p>

Yunus does not see social businesses as a concept that is limited to Bangladesh or the developing world. He believes it can work right here in the United States&mdash;and he noted that if he were to develop a new U.S. social business, he would concentrate on providing health insurance to the uninsured. The social business model might be the perfect solution, since the current profit model has not been able to provide the service. <p>

220,221,The Changing Realities of Humanitarian Assistance: Commentary from 22 Years in the Field,NULL,Forums,"<p>It's a long way from a middle-class upbringing in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, to the refugee camps of Darfur. But for more than two decades, Nancy Aossey's work has taken her to the most desperate corners of the globe, bringing hope and lifesaving medical care to those in need.<p>

Speaking at the Milken Institute, Aossey recounted a career spent on the front lines of wars, famines and natural disasters. As president and CEO of the International Medical Corps (IMC), she has transformed this Santa Monica&#151;based operation into one of the world's most respected relief agencies. <p>

Aossey's approach is not only to provide relief but to train local people help themselves and their neighbors. She recalled a mission to Angola in 1990. ""Instead of sending in a handful of nurses, who could reach a limited number of people, we decided to offer basic medical instruction,"" she explained. ""We trained trainers, and that had a multiplying effect so that more children could be immunized."" Her strategy has become increasingly important in the face of an acute worldwide shortage of doctors.<p>

The realities confronting aid workers on the ground have changed drastically over the years. ""There's been an alarming deterioration of security in the places where we work,"" Aossey explained. ""I first experienced this in the early 1990s in Bosnia, when Serbian militias began to specifically target journalists and relief workers. One of the scariest experiences of my life was driving through Sniper's Alley, where they were picking people off with AK-47s. I knew this would fundamentally change the way we work. The bad guys were willing to target innocents and children. There were no boundaries left."" <p>

Security teams now accompany IMC workers, ensuring that they operate inconspicuously. In Iraq, for example, IMC health-care workers drive battered trucks to blend into the background. ""We have to take risks to work in tough places,"" explained Aossey.<p>  

Aossey described the humanitarian arena as an increasingly crowded space. She noted the growing involvement of the private sector, but questioned the disease-specific initiatives launched by some well-intentioned foundations and corporations. This concentrated vertical funding can produce dysfunctional results - say, a shiny new TB hospital standing across the street from a crumbling, ill-equipped general clinic. Aossey has found that it's more effective to take a holistic approach to health services.<p> 

The technology improvements of the last decade have presented relief workers with new tools of the trade. ""At age 27 I had to make a huge financial decision: whether to spend our money on a fax machine to communicate with Pakistan,"" said Aossey with a laugh. ""Little did we dream how technology would one day change the way we operate."" Today, high-tech tools &mdash; from cell phones to mapping software &mdash; are improving communication, coordination and assessments in remote areas.<p> 

Aossey now finds a greater media presence in the field than ever before. Americans are confronted with immediate images of human suffering in the developing world, beamed right into their living rooms. ""People around the world see more and more that we are bound together. After the tsunami, the coverage tapped into the generosity and the big hearts of Americans,"" she recalled. ""But there are always what I call 'silent emergencies' &mdash; like Darfur &mdash; that just don't get media coverage."" <p>

One thing hasn't changed over the years: IMC's focus on reaching out to young children and women of childbearing age.

Each day, these two nations conduct $1.6 billion worth of cross-border commerce &mdash; more than $1 million every minute. <p>

Given those strong trade ties, border security has become a dominant issue, said Michael Wilson, Canada's ambassador to the United States. <p>

With the United States tightening security along the Canadian border after 9/11, both sides have worked closely to ensure that restrictions don't impact the cross-border supply chain. If it does, ""that will affect both countries' competitiveness,"" he said. <p>

In his talk with Milken Institute Associates, Wilson discussed other key areas of Canadian-U.S. relations, including energy (Canada is America's largest supplier of oil and natural gas), water rights and immigration. <p>

Wilson, a former investment banker and former Chairman of UBS Canada, also discussed the economy and the growing relationship between Canada and California, which have partnered recently on sustainable energy, technology and the life sciences. <p>

Before joining UBS in July 2001, Ambassador Wilson was responsible for RBC Financial Group's institutional asset management business. He also served as vice chairman of RBC Dominion Securities, responsible for senior client relationships and advising both Canadian and international companies and governments. <p>

In 1979 Ambassador Wilson was elected to the House of Commons. In 1984 he was appointed minister of finance, a position he held until 1991, when he became minister of industry, science and technology and minister for international trade. <p>

222,225,"God and Gold: Britain, America, and the Making of the Modern World",NULL,Forums,"The intricate global system of finance, trade and ideology developed by Britain and advanced by the United States over the last three centuries has created a dominating new world order to rival any empire in history, according to Walter Russell Mead, a noted historian and a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.<p> 

Speaking at the Milken Institute, he expanded on the themes of his latest book, <i>God and Gold: Britain, America, and the Making of the Modern World,</i> telling the audience why he believes the Anglo-American system has ruled the world for so long.<p>
 
Maintaining an open society at home was the first key. British and American culture is built on a foundation of religious tolerance, and both nations have flexible and adaptive judiciary systems. Meritocracy and the free exchange of ideas have spurred Britain and the United States to produce tremendous financial, technological and cultural innovations that resonate around the globe, he said.<p> 

The second step toward Anglo-American power, Mead explained, was taking their show on the road. ""Now that you have this productive and innovative society, go out and trade,"" he said. ""Glean the best ideas from all around the globe.""<p>

That emphasis on trade led to another strategy: a foreign policy based on engagement with the world. Mead pointed out that by controlling the seas, both nations created a vast flow of goods and information. Their goal has always been to protect commerce and maintain the balance of power in key geo-political areas. <p>

The fourth key lies in not using this power to crush and dominate. Britain and the United States have a long history of integrating emerging nations and former enemies into the fold as trading partners. Mead sees this pattern repeating itself with China and India: ""To those countries, we are saying: Get rich. Enter the system. Enjoy.""<p> 

The fifth strategy is one Mead calls ""perhaps the most cold-blooded and calculating idea of all"": promoting liberal democratic ideals and institutions abroad. Developing the rule of law makes other nations better business partners; the advent of democratic elections and a free press engages citizens in the world economy.<p> 

He also suggested that Protestantism has played a large role in Anglo-American success.<p> 

""In many societies, religion enforces conformity,"" explained Mead. But Protestantism is more dynamic, placing its emphasis on the individual and providing fertile ground for capitalism and innovation. ""Faith in God equates to faith in the future, even if that future is risky or unknown. Americans embrace this notion of striking out on their own to fulfill their identity.""<p>  

Mead dismissed those who believe that U.S. influence is waning.<p>

""The system is in better shape than the media and the panicky pundits would have you believe,"" he insisted. But he cautioned against complacency. ""Great empires become status quo powers who'd like to stop the clock. We'd like to maintain things the way they are, but policies from 20 years ago will not serve now. The pace of change is accelerating in the world.""

Because of its geographic location, natural resources and pro-West policies, Romania should be a prime investment nation for multi-national companies. But U.S. investors in his country are few. <p>

And that is why His Royal Highness Prince Radu of Romania visted America, which included a stop at the Milken Institute. He is trying to win over U.S. investors, educators, media and policy makers about the potential of his country. <p>

&quot;There is still a huge gap between the western part of Europe and the eastern part,&quot; he said in his meeting with Milken Institute Associates. &quot;But we have performed extraordinarily in this part of the world.&quot; <p>

226,,Associates Breakfast With Former Sen. George Mitchell,NULL,mia,"Foreign policy dominated the discussion as former Sen. George Mitchell joined the Milken Institute Associates for a private breakfast. He shared insights based on his extensive experience in conflict resolution.<p>
Having just returned from Northern Ireland, Mitchell was able to observe firsthand the fruits of the peace agreement he brokered there.<p>
""Where sectarian war once raged, with bombings and assassinations every day, you now have a peaceful, progressive, energetic and rising society,"" he observed.<p> 
Recalling the contentious process of bringing both sides together in Northern Ireland, Mitchell offered hope for peace in the Middle East. He believes that the United States is the only entity that can negotiate and implement a settlement between Israel and the Palestinians &mdash; and the next president will have a window of opportunity to make it happen.<p> 
He cautioned, however, that achieving a breakthrough in the Middle East will require complete and sustained commitment to the peace process. Mitchell reminded attendees that it took five years of complex negotiations to resolve the dispute in Northern Ireland.<p> 
Mitchell outlined several principles for successful negotiations: understanding your own objectives, having the wisdom and the strength to quit when you're ahead, exercising patience, and making sure that each party feels it has had its say. He also noted that economic development is a key ingredient of conflict resolution, since violence and fanaticism flourish where there is widespread unemployment and a resulting lack of self-worth and purpose.<p>  
Mitchell acknowledged that the United States is held in low regard around the world right now. Part of that is inevitable, he noted, since dominance arouses hostility. But he expressed optimism that America can regain its international standing by returning to its basic principles and using its power in a manner that is consistent with its ideals.<p>
Mitchell also touched on  his investigation into the use of performance-enhancing drugs in Major League Baseball.<p> 
Mitchell's appearance was part of a regular series of breakfasts bringing distinguished speakers to meet with the Associates.<p>

Huffington, co-founder of The Huffington Post, gave her take on the presidential race, predicting that the Democratic Party - no matter how bitterly divided at the moment - will come together this summer to form a united front against presumptive Republican presidential nominee John McCain.<p> 
She recalled that she was a McCain enthusiast in 2000, when she viewed him as a reformer. But Huffington emphasized that the McCain of 2000 is not the McCain of 2008. She pointed out that he once challenged religious leaders on the extreme right, but today he is courting their endorsement.<p>
""Back then, he was a real leader and reformer,"" she said. ""The media presents him as a maverick, but he's not anymore."" The challenge for Democrats, she said, will be to cut through that image and educate the public on his record and his actual policy positions.<p>
Huffington reserved some of her harshest criticism for the press.<p>
""There has been a huge realignment in American politics, but the media has not noticed,"" she observed. ""The center has shifted.""<p>
She emphasized that the media has twisted our national discourse by presenting two sides to every issue - left versus right - and giving them equal time without ever taking the extra step of informing the audience which side is backed up by the evidence.<p>
""How many years have we spent debating whether global warming is real?"" she asked. ""It's not always about points of view. It's the facts.""<p>
She said she expects the 2008 presidential race to play out differently than it did in 2004.<p>

228,,High Wire: The Precarious Financial Lives of American Families,NULL,Forums,"The U.S. economy recently experienced one of history's greatest periods of prosperity. But even as it posted undeniably impressive growth, profound changes were taking place below the radar.<p>
Peter Gosselin, national economics correspondent for the Los Angeles Times, believes that U.S. prosperity came with a heavy price tag: the shifting of financial risk away from corporations and the government onto working families. Speaking at a Milken Institute Forum, he described the findings from his new book, ""High Wire: The Precarious Financial Lives of American Families.""<p>
After extensive interviews with 5,000 families at all income levels, Gosselin found that individual households now face greater financial instability. It began after the economic shocks of the 1970s when the U.S. economy underwent a radical free-market makeover.<p>
""Beginning with Reagan, there was a concerted move to deregulate and reel in safety nets. And the medicine seemed to work. By the late 1990s, millions of Americans were lifted up by a powerful and sustained prosperity,"" he said.<p>
But along the way, ""many key struts in our support system have weakened or been kicked out altogether,"" Gosselin said. Even affluent Americans now feel increasingly uneasy.<p>
""Instability has hit the poor very hard, of course, but even those assumed to be the big winners experience more volatility now,"" Gosselin noted. ""Serious life events such as illness, divorce, or losing your job now carry greater risk.""<p>
The introduction of the 401(k) has shifted responsibility for retirement planning from employers to families &#151; ""but one-third of those eligible don't participate, or they manage their accounts poorly,"" Gosselin observed.<p>
He said the pendulum is starting to swing in the opposite direction.<p>
""Today the government is once again rolling out safety nets, not reeling them in,"" he noted, pointing to the Federal Reserve's bailout of Bear Stearns and predicting that we will soon see greater regulation of financial markets.<p>
""If there is any lesson to be learned from the current crisis, it's that households are not financial firms. Families are not hedge funds,"" Gosselin concluded.

Falling home values and a rising wave of foreclosures have dominated the headlines for months. But there is more pain in store. That was the sobering outlook presented by Philip Swagel, Assistant Secretary for Economic Policy at the U.S. Department of Treasury.
<p>
Swagel began by stating that the nation doesn't seem to be in a recession, but he noted that growth levels in the first two quarters of 2008 were unacceptable and unemployment, while low by historical standards, is rising.<p>  
The debate in Washington over designing a stimulus package swirled around whether to target assistance to the housing sector or take broader action, Swagel said. Policy-makers, the president and Congress ultimately made a conscious decision to support the overall economy while letting the necessary housing correction unfold. He pointed to initial evidence in May retail sales figures that the tax rebates are having an effect.<p>
Swagel noted that the futures market is predicting another year of steep home-price declines in the 10 largest U.S. cities. Housing inventories will continue to be elevated through 2009, and construction will remain slow until the market works through this inventory.<p> 
Exactly how many households are in trouble? Swagel showed a chart illustrating that there are 55 million owner-occupied houses with mortgages in the United States. Some 5 million of these owners have fallen behind, and approximately 2.5 percent are in some stage of foreclosure.<p> 
There's plenty of blame to go around, starting with a complete deterioration of loan underwriting standards. But Swagel emphasized that policy-makers must tread carefully in designing new regulations to deal with the aftermath.<p>
""New loan products enabled millions of Americans to get into their first homes,"" he said. ""You don't want to get rid of the subprime market altogether.""<p>
Swagel listed the administration's objectives for housing: 1) avoid preventable foreclosures; 2) ensure the flow of capital into the housing market; 3) enable the necessary correction to happen as quickly as possible so we can move forward; and 4) minimize spillover into the broader economy.<p> 
There's no denying that many people bought homes they simply couldn't afford. The harsh reality, Swagel said, is that many of them may become renters again. If their mortgage was a dramatic stretch over their income, the home probably can't be saved.<p> 
So who should get the help and how should it be allocated? Swagel reminded the audience that someone has to foot the bill for any assistance program.<p>
""We are focusing on people who want to keep their homes and could make that happen with just a little flexibility &mdash; say, extending the term of the loan or refinancing into a traditional fixed-rate mortgage,"" he said.<p>
The administration has actively encouraged lenders to modify loans in those cases, avoiding the costs of foreclosure. Treasury Secretary Paulson has also brought together lenders, investors, non-profit counselors and trade organizations to share best practices. Since lenders typically get a poor response rate when they reach out to delinquent borrowers, the industry is now relying on non-profit counselors to play a greater role.<p> 
Almost 1.6 million people have worked out new loan terms since last July. The FHA has also become much more active, having refinanced 220,000 loans since August 2007.<p>
Despite these positive steps, Swagel cautioned that 1.8 million adjustable-rate mortgages are due to reset in 2008 and 2009.

237,,California's Future as a High-Tech Leader,NULL,Forums,"With the world's eighth-largest economy, California might appear to be immune from challenges to its high-tech leadership. But as the latest edition of the Milken Institute's <i>State Technology and Science Index</i> reveals, its edge is eroding.<p> 

For the third edition in a row, Massachusetts claims the top spot in the <i>State Technology and Science Index,</i> while California has slipped into 4th place overall. California still has the nation's preeminent entrepreneurial ecosystem, and has emerged as a leader in nanotechnology and clean technology. But its systemic problems are becoming ever more apparent.<p>  

At a recent Forum, Ross DeVol, director of Regional Economics, presented the study's findings and issued a wake-up call regarding California's neglect of its human capital.<p>  

After ranking 4th in the study's composite measurement of Human Capital Investment as recently as 2002, California has now tumbled to 13th place in this category. It is now only 16th in the nation in the percentage of its population age 25 and older holding at least a bachelor's degree.<p>

Student visa restrictions instituted after 9/11 have made it harder to attract top foreign talent &mdash; and given recent tuition hikes, the UC system is no longer such a bargain for out-of-state and international graduate students.<p>

""The other major human capital challenge is that California simply isn't producing enough college-ready high school graduates. Our public schools are failing many Latino and other minority children,"" he insisted. ""This is our future work force.""<p>

He noted the tremendous strains on California's education system, and recommended addressing funding levels as well as structural reforms such as teacher compensation.<p> 
 
While California continues to excel at producing the entrepreneurs and capital necessary to convert research into commercially viable products and services, its share of federal R&D dollars has declined, DeVol said, and its academic R&D spending slipped to 19th place this year.<p> 

Despite its concentrations of biomedical, electronics and computer hardware engineers, California also declined in the composite measuring Technology and Science Work Force. The state's intensity of computer and information science experts has declined, as many support operations have been outsourced.<p> 

In the composite measuring technology outcomes (in terms of high-tech employment and payroll, net establishment births and growth), California dipped to 7th in the nation. Even with its remarkable diversity of high-tech sectors, the state is stalling in indicators for growth and business formation.<p>

Maryland and Colorado, with more attractive cost structures, have already surpassed California in overall results since the 2004 report was published. Virginia and Utah are poised to do the same if California cannot staunch the outflow of high-tech workers and shore up its educational base.<p> 
 
""In technology, achieving critical mass is the key to continued momentum, and its sheer breadth of components keeps California ahead,"" observed DeVol. But relying on existing industry ties and the benefits of clustering rather than developing human capital is a huge gamble. ""The old formula isn't going to work anymore.""<p>

""The clear trend in 2008 is increased competition,"" DeVol argued. ""More states are making major investments and adjusting their economic development strategies.

239,,Housing: Beyond the Crisis,NULL,finlabs,"From the subprime meltdown to the unprecedented government bailouts, the current turmoil in the mortgage market is sending shock waves across the political and financial landscape. Federal and state legislators are struggling to find the appropriate regulatory response, capital markets are refining their financing models and the future of housing in America is at risk.<p>
 
To address these critical issues, the Milken Institute hosted a Financial Innovations Lab at the German Marshall Fund in Washington, D.C. ""Housing: Beyond the Crisis"" focused on incentives, market structures and regulatory mechanisms that would enable home buyers to continue obtaining credit from banks, maintaining a flow of financing for affordable housing that is both efficient and attractive to investors.<p>
 
Bringing together researchers, policymakers, and business, financial and professional practitioners, the Milken Institute's Financial Innovations Labs aim to create market-based solutions to business and public policy challenges. Participants in this event included governmental officials, bankers, academics, lawyers, policy advisors, and representatives from rating agencies and nonprofit organizations as well as other experts from the housing and capital markets. The Lab was convened to explore financial innovations that would allow risk-sharing in the housing and mortgage markets, and most importantly, generate concrete plans of action.<p>

The Lab was split into two sessions: one on capital market solutions and the other on affordability products. Both sessions featured presentations and case studies, followed by lively and provocative discussion among the 45 participants. The morning session, moderated by Phil Swagel of the U.S. Treasury Department, focused on current capital market solutions: securitization, covered bonds and shared equity products.<p>

Panelists Tad Rivelle of Metropolitan West Asset Management, Tom Deutsch of the American Securitization Forum and Frank Nothaft of Freddie Mac analyzed the recent problems with securitized products and ways to use these products appropriately. The latest data demonstrates that the deterioration of collateral caused the current wave of massive deleveraging. Much of the discussion focused on the measures necessary to reboot securitization and other financial instruments to promote liquidity and lower costs while increasing transparency. All participants urged a return to the fundamentals of risk analysis in mortgage products and markets. Additionally, the panel recognized the need for a process to unwind securitizations to address bad loans.<p>

Trip Foley of the Treasury Department and Alex Pollock of the American Enterprise Institute focused on the increased use of covered bonds, noting their success in Europe. Unlike asset-backed securities, covered bonds remain on the issuer's consolidated balance sheet and are backed by a pool of assets in case the originator becomes insolvent. They hold great potential, but participants raised questions about how much regulation would be needed to define and standardize this market, as has been done in Europe.<p>
 
The concept of shared equity products, in which investors receive a portion of the equity in a home in exchange for providing a portion of the down payment, was analyzed by Ralph Liu of AeFT Inc. and Jim Gray of NCB Capital Impact. Gray argued that these products ensure occupancy, promote ongoing maintenance and avoid foreclosure; he believes they are effective, sustainable and durable. Liu presented his SwapRent model, in which distressed homeowners can essentially switch to renting their property through an economic landlord, who would credit full or partial monthly payments toward the homeowner's mortgage while sharing any appreciation in the value of the property.<p>

During lunch, the participants enjoyed a presentation by John Courson, incoming president of the Mortgage Bankers Association, who discussed the future of real estate as an investment and the industry's strategies in moving forward.<p>
 
The afternoon session, moderated by James Barth of Auburn University and the Milken Institute, shifted the focus to risk-sharing innovations and the potential for these products to revive the market. Dan Kildee of Genesee County, Michigan, presented the model of Genesee County's land bank, a public authority created to efficiently acquire, hold, manage and develop tax-foreclosed properties, as well as other vacant and abandoned properties. Kildee maintained that the use of land banks could help communities prevent foreclosures and spur housing renovations and new development.<p>

Catherine Godschalk of Self Help outlined her organization's lease-to-purchase product, which is currently being piloted in North Carolina. This model creates a credit enhancement in the securitization process, buying loans from lenders to be subsequently resold to Fannie Mae and repackaged. These 30-year fixed-rate mortgages would offer borrowers a lower mortgage payment than other saleable financing choices. The organization also stresses borrower counseling, an important factor in the day's discussion of transparency in lending.<p>

Adam Levitin of Georgetown University Law Center offered his perspective on how modifications in bankruptcy law could enable financially distressed individuals to renegotiate terms of their mortgages, lowering foreclosure rates and improving value recovery. Finally, John Weicher of the Hudson Institute discussed the limitations of payment assistance programs, especially seller-financed models, which seem to offer little benefit to homeowners while producing higher default rates. Other down-payment assistance programs that might be designed without such moral hazard were considered.<p>

Finally, Jason Bordoff of the Brookings Institution and David Wyss of Standard and Poor's exchanged views about how the election will influence the direction of the housing and mortgage markets and what lies ahead when the next president takes office.<p>

With a single sentence, Jami Miscik, global head of sovereign risk for Barclays (formerly with Lehman Brothers), summed up the financial world's wild ride.<p> 

Miscik is best known for her expertise at forecasting global risk, a skill she honed during a 20-year career in U.S. intelligence. During a recent breakfast with the Milken Institute Associates, she focused on Wall Street's turmoil and how it will affect global markets.<p> 

""There's not a lot of rationality in the market right now,"" she observed.<p> 

She emphasized that Europe has to work through its own crisis, and she believes it will be especially tough for the EU to forge a cohesive response.<p>

""You thought it was tough to bring the House Republicans on board with the bailout &mdash; just try coordinating all those central banks,"" she said.<p>

Miscik believes that one of the biggest challenges facing the incoming U.S. president will be the need to forge a new relationship with Russia. Investors were spooked by Russia's recent invasion of Georgia, she noted, and tensions have also been rising with Ukraine.<p> 

Miscik reviewed several other potential hot spots around the globe, calling special attention to dangers in Pakistan and Iran. She also outlined the hurdles that India and China will face as they try to manage growth in a more sustainable manner. Among the so-called ""BRIC"" nations, Miscik mentioned being especially impressed with the business climate and prospects in Brazil.<p>

241,,"Associates Breakfast With Russ Stanton, Editor of The Los Angeles Times",NULL,mia,"These are tough times for the newspaper industry - and that's especially true at The Los Angeles Times, as editor Russ Stanton acknowledged during a breakfast meeting with the Milken Institute Associates.<p>

The Times has gone through a difficult year of staff cuts, capped by the bankruptcy filing of Tribune Company, the paper's parent. But Stanton outlined strategies that he believes will leverage the paper's traditional strengths in the digital age.<p> 

Stanton held the post of innovation editor before taking the helm of the newsroom in February 2008. In that role, he focused on integrating the paper's print and online operations, an initiative that remains crucial to the long-term sustainability of the Times.<p> 

Now that the paper's online presence attracts 20 million readers, Stanton is training seasoned journalists to work in a new medium.<p>

""In some ways, it's bringing back the old wire-service mentality. You start with solid beat reporting, hop on it, file it quickly and file updates,"" he observed.<p> 

He talked about the paper's new emphasis on ""360-degree storytelling,"" creating interactive packages that enhance traditional stories with graphics, maps or video.<p> 

""Today, readers can get any paper in the world with a click of the mouse,"" Stanton said. ""We have to own certain pieces of the pie. We need to own coverage of the entertainment industry.""<p>

The paper is struggling to monetize its online popularity, given that most Internet users are reluctant to pay for content. LATimes.com generated enough revenue to pay for newsroom operations this year, giving Stanton hope that a new sustainable business model is taking shape.<p>

246,,"Demystifying the Mortgage Meltdown: What It Means for Main Street, Wall Street and the U.S. Financial System",NULL,Forums,"Back in March 2008, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson told CNN, ""I have great, great confidence in our capital markets and our financial institutions.""<p>

Just six months later, it was a different story. ""The financial security of all Americans . . . depends on our ability to restore our financial institution to a sound footing,"" the secretary noted in a press release.<p> 

How exactly did we get from point A to point B? Milken Institute economists Glenn Yago and James Barth provided a detailed examination of that question in a recent Forum.<p> 

Yago began by noting that the word <i>meltdown</i> entered our lexicon after the Three Mile Island nuclear accident in 1979. Since it refers to the core of a plant overheating and setting off uncontrolled chain reactions, it's a particularly apt metaphor for recent events. But he also encouraged the audience to hold on to a hopeful sign: The global economy is posting positive numbers despite the current liquidity problems. ""There is extraordinary vibrancy in the real economy,"" he insisted.<p> 

The story of the mortgage meltdown began when the Federal Reserve, in response to the recession of 2001, began slashing interest rates to historically low levels. The result was an era of easy credit that made homeownership more accessible. Soon new mortgage products were introduced, promising instant access to the American Dream.<p> 

Many subprime borrowers joined the party via adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs), enjoying artificially low teaser rates and banking on the hope of refinancing down the road. The market encouraged this kind of wishful thinking: Barth showed multiple charts illustrating the enormous run-up in home prices created by this surge of demand, with prices in California far exceeding the national average.<p> 

Viewed in a broad historical context, the rapid growth in home values clearly indicated a bubble. The ratios of home prices and household debt levels to household incomes had reached unsustainable levels by 2006, a year that saw $1.2 trillion worth of subprime mortgages originated. ""Those debt levels should have been warning signs to regulators,"" Barth stated.<p>

Many of these new loans &mdash; especially those obtained with no money down &mdash; proved untenable when home prices began to sink in 2007. Today some 5 million households are falling behind in payments, with the worst default rates seen in subprime ARMs. ""The products themselves are not necessarily bad,"" observed Barth. ""It's how they were used. You can't blame products for being used inappropriately.""<p> 

Five million mortgage loans in default is no small problem, but even so, how did matters snowball to such a degree that major U.S. financial institutions were toppled? The answer lies in securitization, as lenders moved from an originate-to-hold model to an originate-to-sell model. By 2005&#151;2006, two out of every three mortgages were securitized &mdash; and those securities grew increasingly complex. Rating agencies proved to be of little help; 51 percent of all new securities issued in 2007 were rated AAA by S&P, for example. Barth cautioned that people generally tend to think that AAA means no risk, but that's a dangerous assumption, since there's nowhere to go but down.<p> 

Many financial institutions became highly leveraged participants in the freewheeling market for credit default swaps (which Barth described as ""ticking time bombs""); these derivatives &mdash; coverage by the banks of the securities they sold &mdash; were essentially enormous wagers on whether the underlying mortgages would default. This market took on a life of its own, with exposures far exceeding the value of the underlying mortgages. ""When you're highly leveraged,"" explained Barth, ""even a small decline in asset value can cause huge losses and increase the risk of insolvency.""<p>

When those massive, murky bets went sour, the lack of transparency surrounding the original securitizations caused financial institutions to eye each other's balance sheets with suspicion, worsening the sense of fear and uncertainty. Left exposed with high leverage ratios and huge losses, some of the nation's largest banks and financial firms have fallen, sending the stock market into a tailspin. The Federal Reserve's efforts to pump funds into the economy have so far failed to increase liquidity, restore confidence and set the gears of lending back in motion.<p>  

Meanwhile, Main Street is also dealing with the ramifications of the credit crunch, as firms, municipalities and individuals are unable to obtain the funding they need to do business. The distressed housing market continues to take a toll on individual homeowners, though Barth noted that much of the real pain is limited to California, Arizona, Nevada and Florida. Foreclosure rates have doubled since 2006, and even those who are in no danger of default have watched their equity vanish. Most economists feel that the housing market has yet to hit bottom, and may not stabilize until home prices fall another 15 percent.<p>

So where do we go from here? As of the Forum, the fate of the rescue plan being debated in Congress remained uncertain. Meantime, the private sector is working to establish a new clearinghouse or exchange structure for derivatives that will provide greater transparency.<p> 

Barth pointed out the patchwork web of regulatory agencies overseeing various financial sectors. He underscored the urgent need to modernize and streamline the functions of U.S. regulators, noting that ""you would never tell another country to design a regulatory regime this way.""<p> 

Barth and Yago also discussed the controversy surrounding ""mark-to-market"" accounting rules, which have made the pricing of mortgage-backed securities even more perilous in this environment.<p> 

But their ultimate verdict was that recapitalizing financial institutions is absolutely paramount. An audience member expressed concern about the current wave of consolidation creating even more institutions that are far ""too big to fail,"" but Barth felt that the survivors should be considered not as simply behemoths in the U.S. market but as global players. Modernizing and recapitalizing the U.S. financial system in this complex new era will be the key to ensuring the nation's competitiveness on a global basis.<p>

The Milken Institute Israel Center held a series of events in November 2008 to address water shortages, wastewater and environmental degradation issues facing Israel and its neighbors.  Participants began  with a tour of the Kidron River Valley, an important revitalization project in need of funding. The group of U.S. and Israeli water experts also met with Ministry of Finance officials to discuss possible finance models that could replace the current antiquated funding structure.
<p>
The center then conducted two Financial Innovations Labs to discuss financing water restoration in Israel, Jordan and areas under control of the Palestinian Authority. Water engineers from the United States and the Middle East joined representatives from local municipalities, the capital markets and academia to design an implementation plan. <p>
The first session, held at Mishkenot Sha'ananim in Jerusalem on November 5, 2008 featured U.S. financial and policy innovation pioneers Peter Taylor of Barclays Capital, Susan Weil of Lamont Financial and Steve Townley of the Missouri Environmental Improvement and Energy Resources Authority, who explained how a state revolving fund works as a finance mechanism. This model allows government grants to be matched by local resources to ensure a steady flow of capital into river projects. The revolving structure allows the fund to make loans to local river/stream projects, which in turn generate income to repay the original investment and recapitalize the fund. Local river authorities can leverage their resources, which are secured by the revolving capital in the fund, to issue bonds for more than one project at a time.
<p>
The second session, held the following day, focused on the ability of such a fund to work regionally, with the creation of a multinational committee to oversee restoration projects. According to Aaron Wolf, a professor of geography in the Department of Geosciences at Oregon State University and an expert in water conflict management and transformation, cross-boundary water solutions are only successful when all parties can move past political mistrust. Gidon Bromberg, director of the Friends of the Earth Middle East, also noted that a legal framework must be established for the creation of a multinational committee, with active participation from local communities.<p>
Two subsequent meetings were held to form steering committees, one focused on Israeli rivers, the other addressing regional issues. The work of the committees was complemented by research undertaken by the Koret-Milken Institute fellows assigned to the Ministry of Finance and the Knesset.<p>

From Silicon Valley&prime;s Internet innovators to San Diego&prime;s biotech clusters, California has long been a leader in high tech. 
<p>

But according to a recent study by the Milken Institute, that leadership position is being challenged &mdash; not only nationally, but globally.<p>

To examine what California must to do prevent an erosion of its technology and science assets, the Milken Institute and Goodwin Procter brought together several of the state's leaders in technology and public policy to offer their insights on the challenges that lie ahead.<p>

Panelists included <b>Tim Draper</b>, founder and managing director of Draper Fisher Jurvetson; <b>Robert Klein</b>, chairman of the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine; <b>Gavin Newsom</b>, mayor of San Francisco; and <b>Ross DeVol</b>, director of Regional Economics at the Milken Institute and the author of California's Position in Technology and Science. <b>Stephen Ferruolo</b>, a partner at Goodwin Procter, moderated the discussion at the Stanford Park Hotel.<p>

The panelists agreed that California still has many strong assets, including some of the best universities in the world and a strong entrepreneurial spirit.<p>

But the high cost of doing business, high taxes and the state's poor K-12 education system are causing many tech firms to look elsewhere, they warned.<p>

To overcome these challenges, the state must create a more favorable business climate and offer incentives to high-tech companies and their employees.<p>

One positive example, Klein said, was the 2004 decision by voters to approve the $3 billion stem cell research initiative, which gave a tremendous boost to this important new life sciences sector. The result could be thousands of new high-paying jobs that will lift the state&prime;s overall economy, he predicted.<p>

""It&prime;s an investment in our intellectual capital that will drive prosperity in the future,"" Klein said. ""We are making a long-term strategic investment.""<p>

As President Clinton's first chief of Staff, McLarty learned first-hand the critical transition from campaigning to governing, as well as the all-important first 100 days in office. <p>
Based on what he's seen so far, the transition from President Bush to President Obama is going well. Both men and their staffs are taking the transfer of power seriously, which they must at a time when America is at war in two countries and is suffering from its worst financial crisis in more than half a century, McLarty said. <p>
""This transition is a particularly important one,"" McLarty told members of the Milken Institute Associates. <p>
When Obama takes office in January, the new president needs to focus on three things: the economy, avoid contentious issues and find a balance in dealing with the Democratic Congress. <p>
While many in the country believe the United States is headed in the wrong direction, McLarty said the election of a new president offers a chance at a new beginning for Americans. <p>
""Our country is a country of tomorrow,"" he said. ""It's a country of hope and promise.""<p>
If Obama is able to deal with the economic situation in a positive way and restore people's confidence that things will turn around, he should do well, he said. <p>
During his talk, McLarty also touched on the issues of trade, Latin America, the financial bailout measures, and globalization. <p>

255,,"Sam Wyly: 1,000 Dollars & an Idea",NULL,Forums,"
Sam Wyly is a rare breed: a down-to-earth billionaire.<p> 

When Wyly sat down for a conversation with Michael Milken at a recent Milken Institute Forum, he was surprisingly unassuming, even when recounting his impressive string of blockbuster deals.<p>

Wyly is a ""serial entrepreneur,"" observed Milken. Wyly's story began with just $1,000 of his own savings, which he used to found University Computing in 1963. When he took the company public two years later, it made him a millionaire before age 30 &mdash; not bad for the son of a Louisiana cotton farmer.<p>

""Sam is living proof that anyone has the chance to build a successful life and change the world,"" said Milken.<p>

Wyly's Midas touch has served him well for more than four decades, as he expanded Michaels Stores and Bonanza Steakhouses to more than 1,000 locations nationwide and established two major hedge funds. More recently, he founded Green Mountain Energy, America's largest provider of clean electricity from renewable sources such as wind and water.<p> 

The inspiration for this venture came from Wyly's youngest daughter, who came home from school one day demanding to know what her dad was going to do to stop air pollution. And so Green Mountain was born &mdash; though Wyly noted its original name was Green Mountain.com (""because the folks on Wall Street were giving away free money to anything that had dot-com in the name back then"").<p> 

Though he has been a lifelong Republican, Wyly revealed that he is an enthusiastic supporter of President-elect Obama, whom he regards as living proof that ""America is a land of opportunity for everybody."" Wyly is excited by Obama's focus on alternative energy.

""He believes it can create 5 million jobs, and I think it can,"" Wyly predicted, noting that the nation needs to maximize the wind belt that runs from North Dakota through Texas. He acknowledged that falling oil prices will make it harder for green energy to take hold in the short term, but he believes the shift is imperative.<p>  

Wyly's own policy prescription involves adding a carbon tariff to products produced here and abroad. He believes the move would end the era of cheap goods produced in dirty factories, and proceeds in the U.S. could be earmarked for shoring up Social Security and Medicare.<p> 

The first attempt to take Green Mountain public in 1999 fizzled, but that initial setback did not deter Wyly. He was matter-of-fact about the stumbles he has made, noting that failure is simply a fact of life in the business world. Learning how to set goals, persevere, and handle those occasional failures are lessons he still attributes to his high school football coach back in Louisiana.<p> 

""I was a little guy in a big guy's game,"" he said. ""But sometimes if you get there just a piece of a second ahead of the other guy, you can make a play.""<p>

256,,Where Is the Economy Headed? A View From the Presidential Campaigns,NULL,Forums,"
Worries about the economy have dominated the home stretch of this year's presidential campaign. As voters head to the polls, the Milken Institute hosted a lively debate between Michael J. Boskin, professor of economics at Stanford University and a key adviser to Senator John McCain, and Leo Hindery, Jr., an experienced media executive who is an economic and trade adviser to Senator Barack Obama.<p> 

Their discussion produced a few sparks &mdash; and revealed two starkly different visions of America's economic future.<p> 

Obama's economic plan centers around restoring the ""shattered contract with the middle class,"" said Hindery, who emphasized that income equality now rivals levels last seen in 1928. He listed Obama's priorities: a true manufacturing policy, infrastructure investment, better government oversight, a more measured embrace of free trade and a fair tax system. The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, he noted, estimates that 95 percent of households and 98 percent of small businesses would see tax reductions under the Obama plan.<p>

Boskin's response was rooted in a deep belief in smaller government. He cautioned against moving toward European levels of taxation, regulation and government spending, which he feels will lower the U.S. standard of living. His prescription called for keeping taxes (including corporate tax rates) relatively low and avoiding regulation that would micromanage the economy. He warned that Obama's plan could lead to a majority of voters collecting more from the government than they pay in taxes, a scenario he described as ""an unhealthy political dynamic in a democracy.""<p> 

Boskin and Hindery repeatedly squared off on the topic of free trade. Boskin charged that Obama was ""blazingly protectionist"" during the primaries, with ""radical and dangerous ideas, like unilaterally tearing up NAFTA, which has worked well."" Hindery disputed the success of NAFTA, insisting that it has cost a million U.S. jobs and that Boskin's proposal to simply retrain displaced workers won't work. ""You can't retrain your way out of this. It's a head-fake.""<p>

Moderator Peter Passell of the Milken Institute asked the speakers to outline how their candidates would jumpstart the economy. Boskin dismissed the last stimulus bill as ineffective; he also cautioned against the large increase in government spending proposed by Congressional Democrats, arguing that infrastructure projects take too long to initiate. Hindery countered that Senator Obama believes that America urgently needs to restore its infrastructure and that targeted projects will create new jobs.<p> 

As for intervening in the mortgage markets, Boskin noted that Senator McCain has proposed allocating $300 billion of the $700 bailout plan for refinancing troubled mortgages. He predicted that housing prices will have to continue falling to unwind the effects of the tremendous bubble. ""We need damage control for now, but when it&prime;s over, we need to get the government back out,"" he stated.<p> 

Hindery emphasized that the government must address distressed homeowners, not just institutions. He proposed buying mortgages at par from institutions and ending the era of deregulation. While conceding that the government may make mistakes, he insisted that the current predicament is so acute that it demands action. <p>

Boskin warned against taking Obama's approach in this volatile environment. ""A crash and a recession were turned into the Great Depression by tax increases, protectionism and bad monetary policy,"" he observed.<p>

But Hindery remained unmoved. ""A continuation of the same tax policies is not going to fix this.""",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,10,22,2008,NULL,NULL,0,4:30 - 6:00 p.m.,Santa Monica,"Michael J.

257,,Stimulating Investment in Emerging-Market SMEs,NULL,finlabs,"Risk capital - patient, non-asset-based capital that facilitates growth of new and expanding companies - is too scarce for small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in developing countries. Although SMEs are critical engines of job creation and economic growth, risk capital remains largely unavailable to such businesses, undermining their ability to expand and benefit their communities.<p> 

To address this issue, the Milken Institute (with support from Google.org) hosted a Financial Innovations Lab. Fund managers, investors, entrepreneurs, researchers, and representatives from development finance institutions and foundations gathered to identify the obstacles in expanding capital access for SMEs and to explore potential solutions.<p> 

A major challenge in financing emerging-market SMEs is the difficulty of exiting the investments. Underdeveloped capital markets and a shortage of buyers in these countries make exits hard to achieve, thereby increasing investment risk and decreasing the number of potential investors.<p> 

Lab participants explored both first-party exits, in which the entrepreneur buys back the investor's shares, and third-party exits, in which the company is sold to another financial investor or to a company within the same industry (i.e., a trade sale). Case studies of each exit type, prepared by Tom Gibson, president of the Institute for SME Finance, provided examples of successful SME investments and challenged participants to think about how to replicate these results.<p>  

In addition to examining the structures of successful investments, participants considered ways to increase capital to emerging-market SMEs. Reducing costs - by making back-office functions more efficient, for example - is one way to increase overall return. Furthermore, use of technical assistance can help accelerate a company's value.<p> 

Participants also highlighted the importance of the relationship between investor and investee, including good communication between the parties. Finally, several participants noted the value of the investor being local to the investment. Thierry Sanders, director and founder of the BiD Network Foundation, explained BiD's plan to use business angel networks to source deals and scale-up capital to where it is needed most.<p> 

Innovative financial solutions were also considered. Wayne Silby, founding chairman of the Calvert Funds and president of the Calvert Social Investment Fund, discussed the potential creation of a permanent capital vehicle for SMEs. Jim Polan, vice president of SME Finance at the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, explained his idea for the development of an exit finance facility.<p>

<p>

""I tell everyone that I sleep like a baby these days,"" he said. ""I wake up screaming every two hours.""<p>

Referring to 2008 as ""a year in which there was no place to hide,"" Ailman stressed as a public investor with an exceptionally long horizon, he must take a steady approach. ""You can build a portfolio to withstand a 100-year event, but it will underperform in the other 99.""<p>

These are unprecedented market conditions, in which past assumptions about the relationships between various baskets of assets were upended -- everything wound up being correlated.<p>

""Risk has increased exponentially in a global world,"" he observed. ""We've experienced an attack on U.S. soil and a 1929-style financial event in one decade.""<p> 

Yet Ailman sees opportunities, even in these battered markets. One strategy in this environment may be to move into debt instruments, finding high-quality assets from distressed sellers.<p> 

Ailman believes we will see no early indicators signaling that the stock market is about to rebound.<p>

""The news will still be bad, and one day it will turn for no good reason. The cash from the sidelines will come flowing back in.""<p>

<p>

With a new administration in charge in Washington, ""change"" is the mantra of the moment. But are Americans truly ready to rethink their fundamental assumptions - and discard the notions that are holding us back?<p>  

Author and NPR host Matt Miller makes a compelling case for shaking up the status quo in his latest book, ""The Tyranny of Dead Ideas: Letting Go of the Old Ways of Thinking to Unleash a New Prosperity.""<p> 

At this Milken Institute Forum, Miller challenged the audience to reconsider conventional wisdom, including beliefs such as:<p>  
<li> Our kids will earn more than we do.<br>
<li> Free trade is always good, no matter who gets hurt.<br> 
<li> Employers should be responsible for health coverage.<br>
<li> Taxes hurt the economy.<br>
<li> Schools are a local matter.<br>
<li> Money follows merit.<p>

Miller proposes a sea change in our way of thinking based on an honest assessment of the forces currently at work. In the words of Time magazine's Joe Klein: ""'The Tyranny of Dead Ideas' offers the most plausible way to renovate our political and policy thinking to meet the challenges of the 21st century &#151; if we have the guts to go forward.""<p>

Thirty-five years ago a local billboard went up, commanding passersby to ""Smile Los Angeles! You're the Center of the Universe!"" Hyperbole? Perhaps, but author James Flanigan argues that Southern California is a dynamic economic model for American competition in a global world.
<p>

Flanigan has distilled the insights gained through decades of reporting on the region's economy into a new book, which he discussed at a recent Milken Institute Forum.<p>
 
At a time when we are inundated with dour headlines about California's fiscal crisis, he offered a bracing reminder of our region's vitality and its capacity for innovation.<p> 

His book celebrates the engines of our past, present and future growth, including cutting-edge technology, the evolution of the entertainment industry and ports that are well-positioned to capitalize on trade with rapidly rising Asian economies. Because Southern California offers newcomers the ability to completely reinvent themselves, Flanigan argues, the region benefits from a steady stream of ambitious new arrivals who replenish its ideas, capital and can-do entrepreneurial spirit.<p> 

For 45 years, James Flanigan has covered business and economics for The New York Times, Forbes and other leading publications. He has reported on international economies from Europe to Asia, from Latin America to the Middle East. His column in the business section of The Los Angeles Times ran for more than two decades.<p>",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,3,24,2009,NULL,NULL,0,4:30 p.m. - 6:00 p.m.,Santa Monica,James Flanigan,1,0,NULL,1,0,0,0,1,032409forum.jpg,"{length = 8, bytes = 0x0000000000240ef1}",NULL,NULL,NULL,2005-10-21 10:30:22.000,2005-10-21 10:30:22.000,2009-03-24 00:00:00.000,NULL,NULL,39894,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL
266,,"Infrastructure Finance: The Grid, Renewables and Beyond",NULL,finlabs,"The Milken Institute, in conjunction with the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Office of Energy Policy and New Uses, convened a Financial Innovations Lab in Washington, D.C., to address strategies for financing upgrades to the U.S. electrical grid.<p> 

This event focused on how America can achieve long-term sustainability of energy production and consumption, as well as how rural communities can profit from the shift to wind and solar power. Participants included leading scientists and technologists, rural stakeholders, utilities, regulators, banks, institutional investors and venture capitalists, public decision-makers, think tanks and clean-tech industry associations.<p>

The Milken Institute's Joel Kurtzman highlighted key issues that need to be addressed in order to scale up generation and transmission of renewable energy. Not only has there been a lack of investment in the electric grid for the past five decades, but that neglect is compounded by the absence of comprehensive regional planning, complex cost allocation rules and inadequate financial incentives for new transmission developments. Piecemeal regulation and a lack of federal authority also create significant challenges for choosing sites.<p>  

Richard Kauffman, CEO of Good Energies Inc., pointed out that both a ""centralized"" and a ""distributed"" solution for the development of renewable energies could lead to efficient outcomes. Renewable portfolio standards, for example, could be either national or regional. He also observed that capital market solutions could emerge to provide long-term financing for these assets of similar maturity. Doug Gotham of Purdue University noted that the job of utility forecasters is getting increasingly difficult due to growing congestion on the grid and the lack of long-term planning for generation and transmission resources.<p> 

Substantial investment to expand the electrical grid is certainly needed, according to Richard O'Neill, chief economic advisor at FERC. But he argued that a lot can be done in the short term to optimize the operations of the actual configuration of the grid in order to accommodate as much renewable energy as possible.<p> 

Carol Werner of the Environmental and Energy Study Institute discussed the challenges faced by community wind projects (i.e., locally owned, commercial-scale wind projects that optimize local benefits) on a daily basis. These include a lack of adequate financing instruments, lukewarm support from policymakers, the absence of a national market for community wind, and inadequate distribution and transmission infrastructure. Some possible solutions were outlined, such as the establishment of a ""national community wind clearinghouse,"" expanded public financing options (such as state-revolving funds, grants and low interest-rate loans) and revised interconnection priorities.<p>

William Lazarus of the University of Minnesota analyzed the role of farm-based anaerobic digesters as a potential energy source. Although today there are only 125 operating manure digesters in the whole United States, with a total electric generation capacity of 35 MW, AgSTAR estimates that some 6,500 large dairy and swine operations could potentially operate profitable biogas systems. This mobilization could provide 802 MW of capacity to the electric system and significantly increase farmers' income.<p>

Juan Torres of Sandia National Laboratories noted the lack of technology options for storing electricity; the only viable opportunity for extensive energy storage lies on the generation side in the form of fossil fuels. Although it may not happen for 15 to 20 years, the breakthrough in this field could come the day when plug-in vehicles are deployed on a large scale, enabling all residential and commercial buildings to add storage capability to their own small-scale energy systems. Torres also analyzed the role of geothermal energy, a mature and attractive technology whose potential is still largely unexploited worldwide.<p>

The final panel of the day focused on possible financial solutions. Richard Pietrafesa of Destiny USA illustrated the financial model used to fund the development of his resort, a platinum LEED facility that sits on a former brownfield in upstate New York. Pietrafesa explained how, in partnership with government, Destiny USA was able to leverage Payments In Lieu Of property Taxes (PILOTs) and other government programs to finance all project development.<p> 

Nancy Pfund of DBL Investors talked about two of the business ventures financed by her firm: Tesla Motors and Bright Source Energy. For Tesla, DBL Investors was able to obtain bond guarantees from the DOE, although the process required time and struggle. Bright Source Energy, the world's largest solar power plant, was financed almost exclusively through power-purchase agreements (PPA) with California utilities, thanks to the stringent renewable portfolio standard effective in the state. According to Pfund, though, inadequate transmission capacity remains the biggest challenge to the feasibility of such projects. Carol Whitman, a senior legislative principal at the National Rural Electric Cooperatives Association, stressed the difficulty of applying traditional financing methods to coops, which are not-for-profit, non-taxable entities.<p> 

Carol Werner emphasized the need to standardize financial instruments and expressed some frustration at the risk-averse attitude of most banks when it comes to financing renewable projects.<p> 

The remainder of the day was devoted to addressing regulatory issues. All participants agreed that these hurdles shouldn't excuse inaction. Predictability of regulation emerged as a crucial factor that could help investors take on more risk and inject more capital into the green energy sector and its infrastructure. The current financial and economic climate provides a one-of-a-kind opportunity to redefine the roles of the federal government, states, municipalities and the private and financial sectors in tackling the big challenge of sustainability. It's a moment we cannot fail to seize.<p>

</TABLE>
Los Angeles is the gang capital of the world. From the San Fernando Valley to South Central, hundreds of people lose their lives each year as a result of gang violence. The Los Angeles Police Department alone handles more than 6,000 gang-related crimes a year. Gangs control activity on the streets and from within  prison walls.
<p>  

Today, for the first time, those who fight gang violence are coordinating their efforts. They have broadened their approach to focus not just on suppression, but on holistic neighborhood interventions.<p> 

This ""hot zone"" strategy engages cops and gang intervention officers, religious leaders and teachers, all working hand-in-hand on everything from reducing school dropout rates to finding jobs for gang members so they can leave the streets behind.<p>

These innovators are making progress, but we need to do much more. We need to address the financial cost of the violence. We need to understand the size of the criminal economy and how to provide alternative work options to would-be gang members. We need to make our schools safe havens, and change the culture in our communities so it becomes cool to say ""no"" to gangs. We need the creative community to become engaged so urban youth are encouraged to spread anti-violence messages in lieu of tagging.<p> 

Fortunately, there are models that work. Education helps keep youth out of gangs, while A Better LA and other local organizations provide alternative activities. The gold standard is Homeboy Industries in Downtown Los Angeles, which provides valuable training and work experience for gang members through its cafe, bakery and other businesses. We must figure out how to scale up these efforts and win this fight.<p>  

This Forum brought together leading experts in street gangs to talk about the hot zone approach and other strategies for reducing gang violence. They explained why doing so is critical to all members of society, especially in our current economic crisis. <p>

269,Investing with Impact,Investing with Impact,NULL,Forums,"The Milken Institute &mdash; together with Wall Street Without Walls, Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors, Southern California Grantmakers, The Association of Small Foundations, the Bay Area Council and the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco's Center for Community Development Investments &mdash; presented a workshop on mission- and program-related investing.<p> 

This day-long event convened investment officers, philanthropists and the senior staff and boards of foundations to discuss how foundations and philanthropists can invest their resources to achieve both financial returns and mission impact. Mission-related investing (MRI), one of a number of names used for this sort of strategy, is particularly critical in today's economic climate, as donations dwindle, endowments shrink and demands on charitable organizations increase.<p>

Hosted by the Los Angeles Office of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, the event presented perspectives from individual, family foundation and institutional investors. MRI was also analyzed by asset class, with investors and fund managers discussing their experiences in private equity, fixed income and real estate. Also discussed was program-related investing (PRI), which is similar in concept to MRI, but intentionally results in below-market rates of return (MRI, by contrast, provides risk-adjusted market rates of return).<p> 

The first panel of the day explored MRI from the perspective of individual and family foundations. Doug Bauer of Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors defined MRI as ""any investment activity designed to generate a positive social and/or environmental impact in addition to providing a financial return."" He cited a quote from the F.B. Heron Foundation, a pioneer and leader in this field: ""Should a private foundation be more than a private investment company that uses some of its excess cash flow for charitable purposes?"" Bauer stated that the answer is a resounding yes.<p> 

Raul Pomares of Guggenheim Partners discussed his work with the KL Felicitas Foundation in setting up investments that align with its mission. Andy Horowitz, a philanthropist and angel investor on the Advisory Board of the Social Enterprise Institute, noted his success with loan guarantees for charitable organizations, and reported that not one of his invested companies has yet defaulted.<p>

The next panel was on program-related investments. Alvertha Penny, vice president of programs at the California Community Foundation, outlined the Foundation's PRI program and its transition from making direct PRI loans to funding community development financial institutions (CDFIs), a strategy that allowed the foundation to expand its reach. Shari Berenbach, president and CEO of the Calvert Foundation, discussed the Calvert Investment Note, which takes investments from individuals and institutions and uses them to make program-related investments. Berenbach noted that direct PRIs work well for certain non-profits that have sustainable strategies and require only some philanthropy, but they are not the right tool for all non-profits. However, PRIs can also be used for loan funds, which can be tapped by a number of different types of non-profits. Both Penny and Berenbach stressed due diligence and careful monitoring as key to successful investments.<p>
 
A panel on private equity investments followed. Fran Seegull, managing director of Funk Ventures, explained her firm&prime;s strategy of investing with the goal of also achieving a social and/or environmental return. She gave an example of Funk&prime;s investment in Cyber-Rain, a smart sprinkler system that adjusts water use based on weather conditions. Seegull noted that the product saves users on their water bills, and conserves an expensive public resource. Nancy Pfund spoke about her firm, DBL Investors, which also seeks a second bottom line. For example, DBL invested in Revolution Foods, a company that serves healthy food to low-income children in an effort to prevent obesity and the onset of diabetes.<p>

Institutional investors presented their perspective in a later panel. Moderator Betsy Zeidman of the Milken Institute noted that environmental, social and governance factors are risks that should be incorporated into investment decisions. Kathleen Starr, investment officer at the F.B. Heron Foundation, emphasized that social impact does not have to be sacrificed for high financial returns. Sean Harrigan, board president of the Los Angeles Fire and Police Pension Commission, stressed that MRI is an investment strategy, not an asset class. He advised the audience on how to start this type of investing in the face of a skeptical board. He personally started small by investing in workforce housing, immediately winning the support of cops and firefighters.<p> 

Discussions of fixed income and real estate covered the remainder of the day. David Sand, managing director at Access Capital, reported that Access Capital's fixed-income investments are performing very well, despite the recent economic downturn. Karen Kasteel of Kennedy Wilson talked about the firm's investment in low- to moderate-income real estate tracts. On several projects, the firm was able to get an internal rate of return exceeding 30 percent, in addition to making the properties safe and secure. Con Howe, managing director at CityView, noted that fund managers working on mission-related investments have to be very passionate and hands-on with the work they do.<p>

The day closed with a summary of findings and a discussion of next steps.

A wave of violence has swept over Mexico in recent months, raising red flags about the instability brewing just south of the U.S. border. What's really driving the drug wars? And what does it mean for relations with the United States?<p> 

Few observers can put Mexico's growing list of challenges into sharper perspective than Vicente Fox, who served as the nation's president from 2000 to 2006.<p>  

Appearing at a special Milken Institute Forum, Fox addressed not only the current breakdown of law and order, but also the need to promote long-term economic development in Mexico. A proponent of globalization and economic integration, he discussed the dynamics of free trade and immigration, along with the recent impact of the global recession.<p>    

Elected president of Mexico in 2000, Fox became the first opposition candidate in 71 years to defeat the powerful PRI party. True to his roots in rural Guanajuato, he maintained his signature cowboy style &mdash; and a reputation for outspokenness &mdash; during his six years as head of state.<p> 

After earning a degree in business administration from Ibero-American University in Mexico City, Fox enjoyed a successful career as a business executive with the Coca-Cola Company. He entered politics in 1988, and became governor of Guanajanto state in 1995.<p>

271,NULL,Responding to the Affordable Housing Crisis,NULL,finlabs,"The fallout from the mortgage meltdown has been most acutely felt in the nation's low- and middle-income communities, where families are losing their homes at higher rates and foreclosures are driving neighborhood deterioration. An increasing number of loans are in distress, and lenders continue to hold on to properties they can't sell. The prospects for a scalable approach to affordable housing are dim at exactly the time when it is most needed.<p>

The Milken Institute held a Financial Innovations Lab to explore mechanisms and strategies for addressing the issue. Is there a way to finance the acquisition and disposition of foreclosures while simultaneously easing the affordable housing crisis? During the daylong session, various proposals were debated by experts from banks, foundations, community development organizations, research institutions, and federal, state and local governments.<p> 

Mary Tingerthal of the Housing Partnership Network (HPN) introduced the National Community Stabilization Trust (NCST), a partnership that brings together four leading community development nonprofits: HPN, Enterprise Community Partners, the Local Initiatives Support Corporation (LISC) and NeighborWorks America. The NCST coalition aims to stem the decline of communities awash in abandoned and foreclosed properties by providing a clearinghouse for distressed REO (real estate-owned, or foreclosed) homes. The group helps local communities obtain REOs from servicers and investors, converting them to properties that support affordable housing and stable communities. Working with major loan servicers, NCST is currently testing its model in the Twin Cities, New York City, Rochester and Memphis. Under NCST, the purchase price is an agreed-upon ""net realizable value"" - that is, the market value under normal conditions, less the costs the seller would avoid by participating in the program (e.g., holding costs such as maintenance, taxes and insurance; transaction costs; decline in value over the holding period; capital costs saved by early receipt of proceeds; etc.).<p>  

Capital allocations are needed immediately to build a comprehensive affordable housing strategy at the local and state levels, according to Harold Simon of the Community Asset Preservation Corporation (CAPC) of New Jersey. CAPC uses a portfolio acquisition approach, works with multiple mortgage servicers and cross-subsidizes its properties. The organization prices assets from the ground up - identifying the actual cost to rehab and dispose of the property. Once those costs are identified, assets are targeted for demolition, land banking, sale at market rate, or rehab and development as affordable housing. The program began last year with the purchase of a portfolio of 47 loans. There is great opportunity for expansion right outside CAPC's front door, as vacant properties are rampant in Newark. While several years ago there were 350 REOs (of which 275 properties sold), Newark now has 950 REOs and posted only 100 sales last year. Simon urged immediate leverage of Neighborhood Stabilization Program funds (administered by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development) at the state level.<p>    
  
Tom Streitz, director of housing policy and development for the City of Minneapolis, presented details of a pilot program he is implementing. The city purchases only the most distressed properties in identified strategic areas, with some targeted for demolition and some for land banking. Funds are provided from the city budget as well as from HUD's Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP), which currently has $5.9 billion in funding to tackle the problem nationwide. Streitz commented that one of the biggest challenges is that municipalities aren't set up to act quickly enough to compete against private investors in the acquisition of foreclosed properties priced at distressed levels.<p> 

The afternoon session focused on the disposition of assets. Bill Goldsmith of Mercy Portfolio Services described the Chicago Neighborhood Stabilization Program and mentioned real estate developers - both for-profit and nonprofit - as the main obstacle to building viable affordable housing solutions. Mercy Portfolio Services, together with the City of Chicago and the Chicago Neighborhood Stabilization Corporation, plans to  acquire 1,400 vacant homes starting in March 2009 with the help of NSP funds. By the end of December 2013, most homes will be transferred to future homeowners using various strategies such as lease-to-purchase, interim rental and equity-sharing ownership. Two hundred of the 1,400 homes will be demolished and either rebuilt or used for the purpose of land banking.<p> 

Bruce Marks, representing the Neighborhood Assistance Corporation of America (NACA), advocated a return to what he called ""basic lending"" and underwriting of mortgages, stressing the need for income verification and proper documentation. His organization developed and successfully uses an online software solution that features a user-friendly application process and stores a borrower's documents. This greatly facilitates the underwriting of mortgages, and enables NACA to offer a 30-year fixed-rate product with an interest rate of 4.25%, with no down payment and no closing costs. Only 0.0023% of homeowners who bought this product defaulted on their mortgages.<p> 

The role and importance of the private market in reducing foreclosure rates and helping residents stay in their homes through restructuring individual mortgage loans was repeatedly discussed during the course of the day. One strategy brought forward was aggregating risk capital from accredited investors and matching these funds with those seeking equity investments, such as affordable housing agencies or individual prospective buyers.<p>

Further limiting the number of vacancies and foreclosure evictions was cited by many as the key to stabilizing low- and middle income communities. While the overriding sentiment among attendees was grave concern about the current housing crisis and its negative consequences for disadvantaged communities, some participants expressed great hope that this moment could be seized to build long-term affordable housing solutions. But they also highlighted the importance of being aware of unintended consequences in crafting new policy.<p>

276,NULL,Developing Archaeological Discovery and Conservation,NULL,finlabs,"The demand for archaeological artifacts has encouraged a billion-dollar black market and the destruction of the world's cultural heritage through looting and vandalism. From Peru to Thailand, this destruction not only causes tremendous artistic and historical loss, but also strips local economies in developing nation of potential revenue streams.<p> 

The trade of antiquities blends the legal with the illicit; much of the illegal trade moves within an established and respected market. A murky chain of events exists between the looter and the dealer or curator, which often makes it difficult to determine, for example, whether Incan pottery on the New York auction block was in fact stolen from a site or released from a long-held private collection. It may be impossible to quell the desire to own a piece of the past, but much can be done to regulate the supply.<p> 

To address these critical issues, the Milken Institute hosted a Financial Innovations Lab focused on incentives, market structures and regulatory mechanisms that would foster legal archaeological discovery while generating local economic development to stem looting and promote site preservation.<p> 

Participants included museum curators, conservators, archaeologists, governmental officials, academics, lawyers, auctions houses, collectors, antiquities dealers and economists, as well as other experts from the capital markets.<p> 

Participants identified the major problems facing the market, including:<p>
<li> limited resources to protect sites<br>
<li> inability to quantify supply of objects still underground<br>
<li> poor infrastructure in countries of origin to regulate legal markets<br>
<li> minimal enforcement of multinational laws against wealthy museums and collectors.<p>

Many of the Lab's experts feel that archaeological artifacts belong to the country of origin and that sales of objects should be prohibited unless deemed appropriate by the state. Other experts, however, feel that antiquities are part of the collective global identity and ""belong"" to the international community.<p>

During the regulatory session, much of the debate focused on the Portable Antiquities Scheme, the legal trade of artifacts in the United Kingdom. The Scheme, fiercely opposed by archaeologists as legitimizing looting, has seen relative success in the U.K. in tracking antiquities and educating the public on its cultural heritage. It allows citizens to sell a portion of any antiquities found in a legal market, and was created in response to the increased use of metal detectors to locate Roman coins by local communities. Participants debated the likelihood that this program could be replicated in less developed nations, given the limited resources available.<p>

The financial solution session focused on long-term leases, museum sponsorship and archaeological development bonds. Participants, especially those from the archaeological community, were reluctant to promote solutions that place an unbalanced focus on artifacts, as opposed to cultural heritage as a whole.<p>  

Archaeological development bonds would channel investment from private investors, philanthropies and governments to countries of origin to increase site protection and generate capital for local communities. By pooling potential revenue streams, including tourism, object leases and media licensing, the bonds would create sustainable funding for excavations around the world.<p>

Participants agreed that more research must be done to better understand the size of the current market for antiquities, as well as to develop legally and culturally appropriate solutions to the looting crisis.<p>

277,NULL,Global California: Rising to the Cosmopolitan Challenge,NULL,Forums,"California's economy and land mass are bigger than those of many nations. It influences the world through movies, music and television as well as its top universities and research labs. And with 27 percent of residents born abroad, it is predisposed to international trade and investment and dependent on its immigrant work force.
<p>

Yet California lacks ideas, policies and institutions commensurate with the state's high stakes and global clout, according to Abraham Lowenthal, author of ""Global California: Rising to the Cosmopolitan Challenge."" Many of the state's philosophies and structures date to the mid-20th century, when California was turned inward. Though it revived its international qualities, the state failed to adopt attitudes, policies and institutions to match, Lowenthal says. <p>

279,NULL,"War of Necessity, War of Choice: A Memoir of Two Iraq Wars",NULL,Forums,"
Two wars in Iraq. Two presidents named Bush. Two wildly different outcomes.<p>

Richard Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations and author of ""War of Necessity, War of Choice: A Memoir of Two Iraq Wars,"" gave an insider's view of what he has deemed the orderly, systematic vetting that led the first President Bush to the war in Iraq and the isolated decision-making that led his son to send troops to the same soil 12 years later. <p>

A veteran of both administrations, Haass advised the senior Bush and later Colin Powell, the younger Bush's secretary of state. As the title of his book suggests, Haass believes the elder Bush fought a justifiable war, triggered by Iraq's designs on neighboring Kuwait and Bush's fear that allowing Kuwait to be occupied would send the wrong message to the rest of the world. Diplomacy, sanctions and outright threats had been ignored by Iraqi ruler Saddam Hussein, Haass said, so all other avenues had been exhausted.<p>

The younger Bush fought a war of choice, he said. The decision wasn't triggered by long-rumored weapons of mass destruction, oil interests or pressure from the Israeli government, Haass said, adding that Israel considered Iran to be the real threat. Bush was motivated in part by the fear that the war in Afghanistan had done little to make the United States less vulnerable to terrorism after the 2001 terrorist attacks, Haass said. Bush also believed that regime change in Iraq would be easy and would have a domino effect, possibly bringing democracy to the Middle East, which Haass called ""wildly optimistic.""<p>

While Haass disagreed with the decision to invade Iraq in 2003, he was most critical of what he termed the lack of a rigorous discussion beforehand. He told a now well-known anecdote from his book in which he approached National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice in July 2002 to discuss rumors that an invasion was inevitable. <p> 

""You can save your breath, Richard,"" Rice told him. ""The president has already made up his mind about Iraq.""<p>

""It went ahead before people like me had a chance to argue it,"" Haass said. <p>

Haass drew several lessons from the two wars: <p>

<ul>
  <li> People and ideas matter. ""It didn't have to turn out this way,"" he said, if not for the specific people and ideas involved. <br>
<li> Process matters, he said, because it can protect the nation from people and ideas. The process leading to the first war in Iraq was ""orderly and systematic,"" he said. But in the second war, not everyone ""spoke truth to power,"" so a rigorous process was critical. <br>
<li> Implementation matters. If the administration had deployed more troops, allowed the screening of Baathist officials instead of dismissing them wholesale and kept the Iraqi army intact, the war's outcome might have been different, he said. <br>
<li> Local knowledge matters. The administration didn&prime;t understand the culture and the tensions between the religious sects and tribes, he said. <br>
  </li>
</ul>

Haass called the two wars important case studies representing two competing schools of thought in the debate about America's purpose in the world. One camp sees war as a way to shape the behavior of others - for example, responding to a country's acts of aggression. The other camp sees it as a way to change the internal nature of other societies, he said.<p>

He recommended that the lessons of the two wars serve as a guide for U.S. policies in Iran and Afghanistan, which Haass called President Obama's ""war of choice.""<p>",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,5,19,2009,NULL,NULL,0,4:30 p.m. - 6:00 p.m.,Santa Monica,Richard Haass,1,0,NULL,1,0,0,0,1,5192009forum.jpg,"{length = 8, bytes = 0x0000000000240efe}",NULL,NULL,NULL,2005-10-21 10:30:22.000,2005-10-21 10:30:22.000,2009-05-19 00:00:00.000,NULL,NULL,39950,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

Stuart Pearce, CEO and Director General of the Qatar Financial Centre Authority, recently joined the Milken Institute Associates for a private breakfast to discuss opportunities and the broader economic outlook for the Middle East.<p> 

Designed to attract international financial services institutions and multinational corporations, the Qatar Financial Centre (QFC) affords Pearce a unique vantage point on one of the world's most strategically important regions.<p>  

He began by noting ""the sheer scale of wealth being generated in the Middle East,"" a trend that led to the founding of the QFC as a means of developing and regulating a financial services industry.<p> 

Qatar's recent growth represents a rather amazing turn of events. The nation sits on an enormous reserve of natural gas &#151; and no so long ago, ""you couldn't give the stuff away,"" recalled Pearce. But the development of new technology and infrastructure to extract and transport liquefied natural gas (LNG) proved to be game-changing.<p> 

Qatar has built huge ports, an entire maritime industry and regassification plants, allowing it to control the entire supply chain. By entering into long-term energy contracts with Asia, Europe and United States, it now sits in a solid position.<p> 

The same steadiness of approach has served Qatar well in the financial sector. Unlike so many players around the globe, Qatar was not excessively leveraged or laden with toxic assets. Though falling commodity prices did hit Qatar, it has managed to weather the financial crisis with a minimum of disruption.<p>  

While previous oil booms saw much of the profit recycled back into Western economies, the recent rise in energy prices has seen sovereign wealth funds reinvesting in their home markets. <p>
  
Qatar is intent on seizing this opportunity to ""future-proof,"" according to Pearce &mdash; that is, diversifying beyond hydrocarbons, promoting research and nurturing the human capital that will be needed to build a knowledge-based economy. The country's leadership hopes that these moves will eventually make Qatar more immune to changes in technology or fluctuations in the global energy market. A number of U.S. universities have opened campuses in Qatar, which has also established an enormous cash endowment for medical research.<p> 

In response to audience questions, Pearce offered an overview of regional geopolitics and described the nuances of doing business in Qatar.<p>

282,NULL,Feeding the World's Hungry: Fostering an Efficient and Responsive Food Access Pipeline ,NULL,finlabs,"More than 1 billion people will go hungry each day this year, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations. With a staggering need fueled by the global financial crisis, repeats of last year's food riots in the developing world loom.<p>
 
High food and fuel prices, climate change and natural disasters, weak local and regional markets, and mismatches between supply and demand - these factors have challenged the world's ability to end hunger. Procuring and distributing food aid efficiently and quickly is critical to food security, but organizations that provide humanitarian food assistance - including international relief agencies, national governments and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) - often face significant obstacles to obtaining food at the best price and delivering it quickly to those in need.<p> 

In response to these challenges, the Milken Institute, with support from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, hosted a Financial Innovations Lab on fostering an efficient and responsive food access pipeline. The daylong workshop at the University of California's Washington Center brought together a diverse group of experts from around the world, including representatives from development finance institutions, humanitarian organizations, commodity exchanges, the U.S. government, foundations, financial institutions, and research organizations. Lab participants considered the current obstacles to delivering food aid and brainstormed possible solutions.<p> 


Betsy Zeidman, director of the Center for Emerging Domestic Markets and a research fellow at the Milken Institute, outlined the scope of the problem. She described the challenges that humanitarian agencies face as falling into two categories:<p> 

<li> Risk management challenges, which involve price and supply issues that compromise the agencies' ability to secure food at a reasonable price and in sufficient quantities.<p> 
 
<li> Funding challenges, which involve the unpredictable nature of funding streams that rely largely on donations.<p> 

Lab participants examined two potential solutions to risk management: physical grain reserves and alternative commodity procurement tools. They also explored models from other sectors that could address the unpredictability of funding.<p> 


<b>Improving Risk Management</b><p> 


Grain reserves can mitigate supply risk by serving as an access point for humanitarian agencies in emergency situations. Brian Wright, a professor in the Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics at the University of California, Berkeley, gave an overview of how humanitarian agencies might incorporate grain reserves into their food access pipeline to improve their response time. These reserves also help smooth spikes in commodity prices, he said.<p> 


Kshama Fernandes, vice president of IFMR Capital, discussed the benefits of warehouse receipts programs, storage facilities that allow farmers to use their stored commodities as collateral to gain access to financing. Lab participants saw various challenges with grain reserves, including where they would be located, the potential for fraud, and the need for strong management and clear rules for stock release and replenishment. Brian Wright noted that call options might serve as an even better alternative to physical reserves.<p> 


Julie Dana, senior financial specialist at the World Bank, described forward purchases and alternative procurement tools that humanitarian agencies might use to manage price risk. She reviewed traditional procurement tools, such as reserves, in-kind commodity donations and spot purchases, and described the advantages of alternative tools, including pre-positioned stocks, forward purchases, call contracts, futures and options.<p> 
 

As one example, the government of Malawi used a call option to assure supply and cap the price of maize during the lean season, Dana said. In addition, the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) has had success with its forward purchase pilot, according to Robert Opp, special advisor to the executive director at the WFP.<p> 
 

Some Lab participants expressed doubt that the boards of humanitarian agencies would fund call options premiums. But Panos Varangis, principal banking specialist at the International Finance Corporation, likened options to a form of insurance and stressed that they are worthwhile even if they are not always exercised because they can be huge cost-saving mechanisms in the event of a crisis.<p> 


<b>Stabilizing funding streams</b><p> 


A humanitarian agency's funding will be inefficient by definition, as the clients are not the customers, said Michael Klein, an advisor to the WFP. Because outcomes do not affect donors directly, inefficiencies will naturally occur, he said.<p> 


Although a number of sophisticated financial instruments have long been used in the private sector, they have not been used as widely by food aid agencies, Klein noted. Updating the tools humanitarian agencies use and improving their efficiency is critical, he said.<p> 


Glenn Yago, director of Capital Studies at the Milken Institute, presented various financial models that have been used in other sectors to stabilize funding, including advance market commitments, the World Bank's Green Bond, the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility and the International Finance Facility for Immunisation.<p> 
 

Whatever the model, Lab participants stressed that the costs of funding day-to-day operations be separated from the costs of funding emergencies because the two needs differ substantially.<p>

</TABLE>
""Here we go again,"" said California State Treasurer Bill Lockyer, summing up the recurring partisan gridlock that produced a 2009 budget impasse of epic proportions.
<p>

At a private breakfast briefing with Milken Institute Associates, Lockyer reminded the attendees that Sacramento didn't always work that way. During his tenure in the state legislature, budget negotiations were marked by discipline and compromise. But in recent years, the state increasingly relied on deferrals, gimmicks and borrowing. When revenues tumbled in the wake of the economic downturn, the day of reckoning finally arrived, he said.<p> 

Lockyer believes that term limits have worsened the stalemate, as freshman legislators are more focused on their donors and more rigid in their ideology. He feels that mediating skills are learned over time, and the constant churning of the legislature produces increased polarization.<p> 

""It's the Hollywood effect. Sacramento has become about fluff and PR, not the day-to-day grind of governing,"" Lockyer lamented. He called for policy to be driven by facts, not polls. ""The plural of anecdote is not evidence.""<p>

While he supports the notion of removing the legislature's two-thirds majority rule for passing the annual budget, he feels it should be kept in place for approving new taxes. ""I think we've bumped the ceiling of potential levies in California.""<p>

Tax increases just aren't going to get through, Lockyer observed. ""It's going to have to be cuts,"" he said. ""My message is to just get it done. We have to be responsible and reconcile these accounts.""<p> 

His guiding principles are to make government more efficient, fix K-12 education and ""don't chase business out of the state."" Lockyer is particularly concerned that the state is cannibalizing higher education, a trend he referred to as ""eating our seed corn.""<p>

Patterson noted that over the last six to nine months, the dollar has been weakening. When consumer confidence ticks upward, she explained, Americans tend to buy foreign goods, creating a bigger current account deficit. And as risk appetite returns, investors are gradually pulling out of Treasuries and money market accounts. Right now they are seeing opportunities in emerging markets, so capital is leaving the United States.<p>

""As long as the world keeps getting better, I think the dollar stays under pressure,"" she remarked. ""But it's important to remember that sentiment is still very fragile.""<p>

Patterson feels that OPEC learned a lesson last year: By raising oil prices too aggressively, they ultimately shot themselves in the foot. She feels that current levels of $70 to $75 per barrel represent a ""sweet spot"" for OPEC, returning oil-producing nations to surplus without harming global demand and recovery.<p>

What exactly is a cosmic war?
<p> 

According to acclaimed author Reza Aslan, it's a religious war &#151; a battle that participants see as a struggle between the forces of good and evil, believing that God is directly engaged on their side.<p> 

Aslan appeared at this Milken Institute Forum to discuss his latest book, ""How to Win a Cosmic War,"" which not only examines the ideology fueling militants throughout the Muslim world, but explores religious violence in Judaism, Christianity and Islam. At a time when religion and politics are increasingly intertwined, Aslan writes that we must strip conflicts of their religious connotations and address the earthly grievances that always lie behind them.<p> 

A keen observer of the Middle East, Aslan has emerged as one of the media's most incisive analysts of the post-election crisis in Iran. In addition to discussing his book, he also shared his perspective on Iran's opposition movement and its potential implications for the region as a whole.<p> 

A member of the Council on Foreign Relations, Aslan first came to national prominence with his first book, the New York Times best-seller ""No god but God: The Origins, Evolution and Future of Islam"" (2005). He holds degrees in religion from Santa Clara University, Harvard University and the University of California, Santa Barbara, as well as a master of fine arts from the University of Iowa, where he was a Truman Capote Fellow in Fiction.<p> 

Aslan is co-founder and chief creative officer of BoomGen Studios, a hub for creative content from and about the Middle East. Born in Iran, he lives in Los Angeles, where he is assistant professor of creative writing at the University of California, Riverside.

The pursuit of precious commodities has repeatedly altered the course of history, dating back to the days when empires went to any lengths to secure access to salt, which was prized for its ability to preserve food.
<p>

It's a pattern that still holds true today, when those who control oil wield inordinate power on the world stage.<p> 

But it's time to bring about U.S. energy independence, insulate our economy against future oil shocks and defuse our entanglement in the Middle East, argued two of America's leading energy security advocates. In their latest book, ""Turning Oil Into Salt,"" Gal Luft and Anne Korin contend that energy independence is not about the amount of oil we use or import - it's about transforming oil from a strategic necessity to just another commodity.<p> 

At this Milken Institute Forum, Luft and Korin described how to make this shift happen. Their approach addresses the roots of our energy vulnerability and emphasizes policies designed to diminish the strategic value of oil through competition, fuel choice, removal of trade barriers on alternative fuels and other domestic and international free-market-based solutions.<p> 

Gal Luft and Anne Korin are co-directors of the Institute for the Analysis of Global Security and founders of the Set America Free Coalition, a bipartisan alliance of national security, religious, business and environmental groups promoting U.S. energy independence. They have published numerous articles and studies on energy security, and have advised members of Congress, presidential candidates, media outlets and think tanks worldwide. They are also co-authors of ""Energy Security Challenges for the 21st Century.""

He began issuing IOUs instead of checks to meet many of California&prime;s obligations until lawmakers passed a budget &#151; only the second time that has happened since the Depression.<p>

At the time, he called the IOUs ""a sign that the state is being fiscally mismanaged"" and a precursor to further credit downgrades for California, already the lowest-rated state on Wall Street.<p> 

How did California get in this position, and how did this summer&prime;s budget battle play out? On Tuesday, October 6, Chiang will discuss the state&prime;s budget and its current financial condition at a Milken Institute Associates breakfast.<p> 

During the previous year&prime;s budget crisis, Chiang called on the Legislature and the governor to fix the state&prime;s boom-and-bust revenue stream. He proposed setting aside capital gains revenue during good years for use in future downturns and reviewing tax breaks on a regular basis to determine whether they are producing the intended benefits and whether they should be continued, cut or expanded.<p> 


Many of these ideas continue to be proposed by Chiang and others as ways to help ease the state&prime;s annual struggle to pass a balanced budget. He will talk about these and other potential solutions and answer your questions.
As the state&prime;s chief fiscal officer, Chiang makes sure the state&prime;s $100-billion budget is spent properly; uses his audit authority to uncover fraud and abuse; serves on 76 state boards and commissions; and helps administer the nation's two largest public pension funds, CalSTRS and CalPERS.<p> 


He was elected Controller of the Franchise Tax Board in November 2006 after serving two terms on the Board of Equalization, starting in 1998. He began his career as a tax law specialist with the Internal Revenue Service and previously served as an attorney in the State Controller&prime;s Office. <p>

</TABLE>
The popularity of biofuels as a commodity and an investment has grown significantly in the past few years. Major market players have begun investing in these alternative fuels, and producers' revenue is expected to almost triple from 2008 to 2018. In addition, the Obama administration expects biofuels to be pivotal in addressing climate change and creating a greener economy.<p>

Yet many institutional, technological and financial barriers still exist, slowing the development of a solid biofuels market.<p> 

To find out how finance might channel more capital into biofuels production, the Milken Institute, in conjunction with the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Office of Energy Policy and New Uses, convened a Financial Innovations Lab in Washington, D.C. The diverse group of participants included leading scientists and technologists, biofuel producers, rural stakeholders, banks, institutional investors, venture capitalists, public decision-makers, think tanks and clean-tech industry associations.<p>

<p><b>Background</b>
<p>

Joel Kurtzman, Executive Director of the Milken Institute's SAVE initiative, discussed the opportunities that biofuels present for the environment and investors alike. Some of the challenges he identified were misallocated funding, badly designed incentives and inconsistent policies. Stephen Kaffka of the California Biomass Collaborative discussed how regulations and environmental assessments had affected biofuel crops. <p>

Christopher Groobey of Wilson Sonsoni Goodrich and Rosati gave the history of project finance as it relates to biofuels, and participants reviewed how insufficient expertise, scarce working capital and backlash from the food industry had damaged investors and the biofuel industry at large. This history lesson was important, Groobey said, because it changed the financing methods and expectations of new project lenders. <p>

Other barriers discussed ranged from the political to the practical. Biofuels production faces opposition because of questions about its contribution to food shortages, the energy returned on investment and its environmental impact. In addition, companies can't  maintain a consistent supply of raw materials, in part because they can't provide enough product to satisfy the contractual demands of potential buyers, creating a chain that hurts the industry's long-term goals. <p>

<p><b>Potential solutions</b>
<p>

Some options explored were hedging strategies for biofuels producers, product diversification and loan guarantee programs. One notion that met with favorable reviews was establishing a chartered corporation that would guarantee biofuel securities and loans. Another was attaching ""toll arrangements"" to biofuel payment agreements, or guaranteeing profits to biofuel producers on the condition that a share of those profits go directly toward expanding production. <p>


Also popular was the idea of creating a working group involving the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Energy, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Treasury to improve communication on energy goals and to enable joint decision-making.<p>

Widely covered by the media, the highlight of his visit was a Financial and Policy Medical Innovations Lab, held in Jerusalem and attended by more than 100 scientists, policy makers, entrepreneurs and business leaders to look at the challenges and opportunities of Israel's biotech sector, building on the strengths of its high-tech human capital. The Lab was designed by the Milken Institute at the request of President Shimon Peres.

<p>Milken engaged the gathering at the Lab in a look at the potential of the nation's human capital - noting that Israel has more scientists per capita than any other developed country and, extrapolating from Nobel laureate Gary Becker's calculations, ""the human capital of Israel is worth several multiples of the officially reported size of Israel's assets as published by the Bank of Israel."" 
<p> 

However, Milken also warned that Israel's education system inadequacies needed to be swiftly and effectively addressed to avoid depreciation and further drain on the human capital assets.<p> 
 
""Israel must address the challenges within its educational infrastructure. Continuing and increased focus on the country's elementary and secondary education system for all citizens will better prepare the next generation to participate in the global knowledge industries of the future,"" he said.<p> 
 
He also noted improvements needed in the financial infrastructure and regulatory systems, ""Barriers need to be reduced to allow for easier entry for entrepreneurs, the capital market needs to be expanded and the concentration of ownership in the banking system needs to be cut.""<p> 

President Shimon Peres agreed with Milken, calling for more regulatory flexibility and financial support for entrepreneurs. He also stated that the need for medical services and products in developing regions, such as Asia and Africa, presents a key opportunity for both goodwill and sustainable business opportunities.<p> 
 
""We have to think differently, mobilize our talents to make ourselves a better people and show the world that goodwill may be the real force of our time,"" Peres said.<p> 
 
Prime Minister Ehud Olmert also attended, focusing his comments on his vision of dedicating 10 percent of Israel's GDP to research in development, which in turn would attract foreign investment. Thanking Milken for his tremendous contribution in drawing attention to the importance of the industry and to the Milken Institute for organizing the event, Olmert said, ""This is one of the most important seminars, in terms of practical ramifications for the Israeli economy, which has been held in Israel in many years.""<p> 
 
Other participants included Yarom Ariav, Finance Ministry director-general; Professor Shlomo Ben Haim, biotech entrepreneur and investor; Professor Raphael Walden, chair of medical programming for the Jerusalem Congress and Deputy Director of the Tel-Hashomer General Hospital; Dr. Ora Dar, Director of Life Sciences, Office of the Chief Scientist; Professor Shlomo Mor-Yosef, CEO of the Hadassah Medical Organization; and Dr. Orna Barry, a biotech and venture capitalist expert.<p> 
 
The Milken Institute brought to the Lab a set of conceptual tools that could leverage great success from the country's existing biotech industry resources. These concepts, which can be found throughout the work of the Milken Institute, the Milken Institute's FasterCures/The Center for Accelerating Medical Solutions and in another Milken organization, The Prostate Cancer Foundation, include using the capital markets as an agent of change to increase global prosperity, transferring successful financial technologies to new regions and industries, using philanthropy to leverage increased funding from public and private sources, and sharing research and medical data to accelerate the development of cures.<p> 
 
Through a mix of presentations and working group discussions, Lab participants were brought up to date on the latest information and ideas, and also had an active role in brainstorming new ideas to break up roadblocks and discover new routes to foster growth in Israel's biotech sector.<p> 
 
Those present noted that Israel faces challenges in the areas of under-investment in technology transfer, a lack of locally based financial services infrastructure and shortfalls in the training and retention of researchers.<p> 
 
""It is much harder today to bring a medical device to market than in the past. Regulation is stricter, there are changes in intellectual property laws, and the process for insurance reimbursement has become longer and more complicated. If I once was able to bring a new medical device to the sales stage for $20 million, today it could cost at least $100 million"" said Professor Shlomo Ben-Haim.<p> 
 
In specially designed workshops, Lab members tackled these issues and developed several solution-generating ideas for both policy and financial innovation. These ideas included:<p> 

&bull;Development of Israel as a global medical financial center, to include strengthening the graduate education systems in business and finance, developing Israeli-based financial services to provide a full spectrum of funding and financing services, and fostering acumen in the specifics of medical research and biotech financing<p> 

&bull;Increasing information technology infrastructure for health records and clinical trials to accelerate medical solutions<p> 

&bull;Creating global collaborations in curing infectious and chronic disease, with specific programs for Turkey, India, Kazakhstan, China and other rapidly developing regions.<p> 

The next steps are to compile a report on the content of the Lab, the creation of working groups to further develop the solution concepts and to bring the Israeli biotech community back together to work on implementation during the Jerusalem Congress in May 2008. <p> 

We also expect to present the findings and a current update on implementation during the 2008 Milken Institute Global Conference.

Named a ""Global Leader for Tomorrow"" by the World Economic Forum, Zachary Karabell has a profound understanding of the intricate web of connections that defines the 21st-century economy.
<p>
During his years as president of Fred Alger and Company, Karabell served as portfolio manager of the highly rated China-U.S. Growth Fund, where his work revealed profound new insights about globalization and increasing convergence of the U.S. and Chinese economies. This complex and sometimes uneasy relationship is the subject of Karabell's latest book, ""Superfusion,"" which he discussed at a recent Milken Institute Forum.<p> 
Karabell has traced the recent evolution of this partnership, as China courted U.S. companies and expertise to speed along its aggressive economic reforms. The United States, meanwhile, finds itself deeply in debt to China while also reaping the rewards of Chinese growth.<p>

Now both countries find themselves in an unfamiliar position. After years of seeking closer integration with the United States, China has begun to question the wisdom of that embrace. The United States, buoyed by China's loans, faces a level of dependency that has generated considerable anxiety. The intertwinement has enhanced the global economy yet undermined the sovereignty that governments crave. But Karabell argued that the fusion has advanced too far for either nation to extricate itself without harm. The challenge lies in our ability to fully accept a new paradigm.<p> 

Karabell is president of River Twice Research, where he analyzes economic and political trends. He is also a senior advisor for Business for Social Responsibility, which develops sustainable business strategies for Global 1000 companies.<p>
 
Educated at Columbia, Oxford and Harvard (where he received his doctorate), he is the author of several books, including ""A Visionary Nation: Four Centuries of American Dreams"" and ""Peace Be Upon You: The Story of Muslim, Christian and Jewish Coexistence.""

From corn and sugar to grass and algae, biofuels have exciting potential to fight climate change and reduce our dependence on oil. As a result, investment in this renewable energy source has been steadily climbing.<p>

From 2008 to 2018, biofuel revenue is predicted to leap from $34.8 billion to $105.4 billion annually. Major market players have begun to invest significant capital in the sector. Exxon, for example, is investing $600 million in Craig Venter's Synthetic Genomics, a company focused on developing biofuel from algae. Additionally, Boeing successfully tested several bio-jet-fuel blends in late 2008 and early 2009.<p> 

Still, significant technological and financial hurdles remain, and scientists continue to debate the environmental pros and cons of biofuel production.<p>

This Forum brought together a panel of biofuel experts to talk about the growth of this sector and its potential for creating a greener economy. They discussed current energy trends, scientific advances, environmental impacts, regulatory constraints and the challenges and opportunities for investors and businesses.<p>

</TABLE>
Very few of America's top pharmaceutical executives actually know their way around a research lab. But John Lechleiter is a rarity: He's an organic chemist who traded in his lab coat for a business suit. Today, as President, CEO and Chairman of Eli Lilly & Company, he brings a unique dose of scientific insight to the executive suite.<p>
Lechleiter recently joined the Milken Institute Associates for a private breakfast meeting focused on the problems with the current drug development model, which he has described as ""taking too long, costing too much, and producing too little.""<p>
Big Pharma is under major pressure in this era of the billion-dollar drug and growing competition from generics. ""The industry has to change and adapt in a fairly radical fashion,"" Lechleiter acknowledged. He described Eli Lilly's increasing emphasis on partnerships and collaborations outside the company, including the use of external resources for clinical trials. Lilly has also developed a venture fund that invests in biotechs and research labs.<p>
He also addressed broader issues of American competitiveness.<p>
""We have to maintain a viable ecosystem for innovation and value scientific inquiry,"" Lechleiter said. ""It's crucial to reverse our declining capabilities in math and science at the K-12 level.""<p> 
He called for sustained investments in the government-academic infrastructure for research, noting in particular that NIH grant need to be long-term.

Chiang gave Associates his view of the recent state budget crisis, including his decision to issue IOUs this summer because lawmakers hadn't passed a budget. He also answered questions about the state's business climate, tax reform, regulations and other fiscal issues. <p>

Chiang was elected controller in November 2006 after serving two terms on the State Board of Equalization. He began his career as a tax law specialist with the Internal Revenue Service and previously served as an attorney in the State Controller's Office. <p>

For those who think actions speak louder than words, meet Frank Luntz. The well-known communications consultant and Republican pollster has made a career out of changing language in an effort to change the debate.
<p>

In the political arena, Luntz helped the GOP transform the ""estate tax"" into the ""death tax,"" change ""school vouchers"" to ""opportunity scholarships,"" and re-cast ""drilling for oil"" as ""exploring for energy."" <p>

One of the most entertaining and informative speakers today, Luntz is as controversial as he is captivating. At a recent Milken Institute Forum, Luntz discussed his latest book, ""What Americans Really Want - Really."" In it, he uses polling in an attempt to answer questions such as: Do Americans care more about the Ten Commandments or the Bill of Rights? Is your nest egg larger or smaller than the average American's? Who deserves a raise first: our teachers, our troops, our police, our health-care workers, or someone else? <p>

He also touched on current debates over health-care reform, cap-and-trade energy legislation, tax increase proposals, and the latest comings and goings from Washington to Wall Street. <p>

Luntz, president of The Word Doctors, is also the author of the New York Times best-seller ""Words That Work: It's Not What You Say, It's What People Hear."" As a consultant, Luntz has conducted more than 2,000 surveys and focus groups for corporate and public affairs clients in more than two dozen countries over the past decade. He has provided communication and language guidance for numerous Fortune 100 companies. He also has been a guest on virtually every talk show on American television, acting as ""focus group czar"" for Fox News during the 2008 presidential campaign. Luntz has written about language for The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, The Los Angeles Times, the Financial Times, The Times of London and The Washington Post. <p>

He recently joined the Milken Institute Associates for a private breakfast meeting to share those thoughts.<p>

Forbes dismissed any attempt to blame the meltdown on the inherent nature of capitalism.<p> 

""Greed is the antithesis of entrepreneurial capitalism,"" he said. ""Greedy people grasp for the moment, while entrepreneurs plan for the future. . . Don't confuse the moral failings of individuals with capitalism.""<p>

He believes that America needs to innovate its way back to health, noting that transformative companies such as Apple, Microsoft and FedEx were born during the deep recession of the 1970s.<p> 

Creative destruction is taking place throughout the economy, Forbes observed. His own company has been undergoing a painful reorganization to cope with the changes sweeping through the media industry.<p>

Forbes was not shy about challenging the Obama administration's approach, calling for lower taxes, a stronger dollar, less government involvement in health care and greater resolve in dealing with Iran and Afghanistan.<p>

The worst recession in decades has shaken faith in our economic system &#151; and even before the current downturn, our culture was curiously ambivalent about free markets and wealth creation. We need a full recognition of how we got here &#151; and why capitalism truly is the best route to prosperity.<p>
Steve Forbes continues to believe that capitalism is the world's greatest economic success story, he said at this Milken Institute Forum. Forbes, whose latest book is <i>How Capitalism Will Save Us</i>, said free markets are not to blame for the economic downturn. <p> 
""Right now, capitalism is under a cloud. People are blaming it for the crisis that we are facing,"" he said. ""But the book discusses what capitalism truly is and why in a crisis usually it's the government policies that bring about the crisis, but free markets get the blame for it."" <p>
Forbes said capitalism is a benign, benevolent system, but it can't change human nature. He largely blamed the Federal Reserve's monetary policy, lax lending standards and mark-to-market accounting rules for the economic downturn. <p>
What should the government do now? Among his recommendations: <p>
<li> ""Stop beating up on the banks"" and encourage them to lend, Forbes said, adding that banks have four times more cash on hand than they did a year ago. <p>
<li> Strengthen the dollar. <p> 
<li> Stop financing government deficits with short-term money. <p>
<li> Remove trade barriers. <p>
<li> Lower taxes to encourage growth and innovation and ""unleash the entrepreneurs."" <p>
In the end, Forbes said, capitalism is about increasing overall wealth and giving more people the chance for a better life.<p> 

Forbes is Chairman and CEO of Forbes Media. In addition to Forbes magazine, he is publisher of ForbesLife, ForbesLife Executive Woman and Forbes Asia. He sought the Republican presidential nomination in 1996 and 2000, running on a platform that included a flat tax, medical savings accounts, a new Social Security system for working Americans, term limits and a strong national defense. He is also the author of ""Flat Tax Revolution: Using a Postcard to Abolish the IRS"" and ""A New Birth of Freedom.""<p>

307,NULL,Scaling Investment in Residential Energy Efficiency,NULL,finlabs,"Residential energy use accounts for 20 percent of the greenhouse gas emissions in the United States. Numerous studies have found that nationwide energy efficiency upgrades would not only pay for themselves but also would significantly reduce emissions and create green jobs in the process.<p>

With that goal in mind, the Milken Institute, along with the Energy Programs Consortium and the Ford Foundation, convened a Financial Innovations Lab at the Ford Foundation in New York. This daylong session focused on strategies for leveraging public funds with private capital to finance home weatherization. It also identified residential energy efficiency financing models that could bring home retrofit markets to a national scale.<p> 

Participants included federal and state energy officials, U.S. government officials, bank executives, institutional investors, secondary market experts, community organizers, foundation officials, and representatives from think tanks and clean-tech industry associations.<p> 

There is still very low market penetration for efficiency upgrades despite the existence of multiple programs. The Milken Institute's Betsy Zeidman pointed out the difficulties consumers face. But above all, there is insufficient amount of private capital available for energy efficiency upgrades. The estimated cost of weatherizing the nation's homes comes to $1.2 trillion, and that kind of government funding is unlikely.<p> 

There are already hundreds of state and local energy loan programs, but only a fraction of the potential energy savings has been achieved. States are considering alternate leveraging strategies and program designs that be implemented on a wider scale.<p> 

The use of public funds presents a challenge, noted Martha Amram, CEO of Ennovationz and a senior fellow at the Milken Institute. She outlined the need for a financial instrument that is cost effective at scale and can drive down interest rates, emphasizing the need for conformity in rules so the mechanism can work across multiple states. This will be difficult to launch in our currently moribund securitization and mortgage markets.<p> 

Participants presented examples of energy efficiency financing models that could be used to scale investment. Mike Lappin of the Community Preservation Corporation (CPC) discussed multi-family housing development based on the CPC financing model, which involves a formal application process, credit review and an energy audit.<p> 

John Berdes of ShoreBank Enterprise Cascadia discussed on-bill repayment through utilities. This loan product is aimed at single-family markets and has no up-front or out-of-pocket costs. Loan repayments are paid via an energy bill, with energy savings generally covering the cost.<p> 

Throughout the session, experts described the advantages and challenges of other possible approaches, including the Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) model, energy efficiency mortgages and unsecured energy efficiency home improvement loans offered through contractors. Keith Welks, deputy treasurer of Pennsylvania, described Pennsylvania's Keystone Energy Efficiency Loan Program, while Louise Kelly, president and CEO of EnerBank USA, shared EnerBank's experience with unsecured home improvement loans.<p> 

Participants split into working groups to discuss the barriers and implementation steps for taking individual energy efficiency financial products to national scale. They concluded that: 
1) one size doesn't fit all; 2) the endorsement of a reliable sponsor may improve consumer confidence; 3) private capital is needed to scale up residential energy efficiency; 4) it's important to design a one-stop shop that is easy, quick and convenient for the consumer; and 5) credit enhancements can lower interest rates and free up capital for secondary markets.<p>

The demand for archaeological artifacts has encouraged a billion-dollar black market and accelerated the destruction of the world's cultural history through looting and vandalism.<p> 
Nowhere is this issue more critical than in the Middle East, where demand for artifacts is feverish. To ensure legal archaeological discovery and conservation, the players must be given incentives to change. By shifting the focus from the value of specific objects to overall cultural appreciation, financial tools can increase funding for archaeological development and preservation in the countries of origin.<p> 
With that goal in mind, the Milken Institute convened a Financial Innovations Lab in Jerusalem to focus on strategies for leveraging public funds with private capital to finance archaeological preservation and conservation. The ideas were based on a previous Lab held by the Institute in Santa Monica in January 2008. Specific models were examined to not only provide much-needed funding, but also to lessen the impact of the illicit trade of antiquities on the region.<p> 
Participants included representatives from Israel's Antiquities Authority (IAA), the Nature and Parks Authority (NPA), the Tourism Ministry, local municipalities, international archaeologists, capital markets experts, finance specialists and representatives from international legislative bodies, including UNESCO.<p>  
Cultural heritage is not often understood as an economic resource, and because equating antiquities with commodities is unpopular with archaeologists and governments in countries of origin, there has been little research into structuring sustainable funding sources. As Glenn Yago of the Milken Institute demonstrated, undervalued markets can be transformed once they are organized appropriately. For example, in environmental finance, pricing the value of carbon has revolutionized the approach to climate-change legislation.<p>
There are significant challenges in preserving Israel's archaeological resources and preventing further destruction through illegal looting. Ze'ev Temkin, architect of the popular sites Caesarea and Masada, explained that there is difficulty coordinating the various ministries and local governments, especially when it comes to launching archaeo-tourism.<p> 
Other participants noted that the current policies of the Nature and Parks Authority hinder sustainability. Currently, all revenue generated from national parks, whether archaeological sites or environmental sites, is channeled back to the central office of the NPA. The parks that create the most revenue often never see any benefit, because their sales supplement the NPA's small budget to maintain all 66 total national parks and 190 nature reserves.<p>
Raanan Kislev, director of the Site Conservation Administration at the Israel Antiquities Authority, discussed how his team manages site preservation despite a very limited budget. The IAA is given an extremely small allocation from the national budget in comparison to other agencies, and the budget specifically for preservation, as opposed to excavation, is even more limited.<p>
Larry Coben of the Sustainable Preservation Initiative of the Archaeological Institute of America discussed how local communities can benefit from sites through microfinance and small business development. Brent Lane of the University of North Carolina presented a venture capital model, demonstrating how a portfolio of sites could be developed and funded though private investment. Glenn Yago presented the Institute's ideas from the previous Lab held on the topic, including an archaeological development bond and other public-private partnerships.<p>
Participants broke into working groups to review the potential revenue streams and local economic benefit of specific sites. Jaffa, Megiddo and Jerusalem were singled out as needing creative solutions to generate long-term preservation. Top priorities for participants were rethinking the marketing of each sites' historical narrative and understanding how to best digitize each site for mass consumption. All participants agreed that sites must work in coordination with local communities to promote preservation while generating economic development.

And with that, the self-described ""professional risk-taker"" let fly with hard-hitting opinions on everything from gridlock in D.C. to the future of newspapers.<p> 

Zell described the current state of play in residential real estate as ""the beginning of the clearing process."" He insisted that ""we'd be further along if the government had stayed out of it,"" calling it fruitless to try to keep people in homes they can't afford. But given the long-term demographic trends in the United States, he is confident that the market will eventually bounce back, starting with multi-family units.<p> 

His outlook was considerably less upbeat for commercial real estate, particularly the hotel business and the office market, where most owners have no equity and transactions have come to a screeching halt.<p>

Retail, too, is going through a painful contraction, Zell said, since ""a lot of retail was created during the boom that was instantly obsolete."" A number of strip centers and marginal malls are in real trouble, he noted.<p> 

Despite the shaky loans they hold, Zell predicts that lending institutions will experience relatively little pain, as private investors will scoop up distressed properties. ""The animal instincts are out there,"" he said. ""I'm still an optimist.""<p>

Nobel laureate David Baltimore is considered one of the world's most influential biologists. He has had a profound effect on national policy on such issues as recombinant DNA research and AIDS and for nine years led the California Institute of Technology, where he still directs the Baltimore Laboratory. <p>

As a scientist, educator and university administrator, Baltimore sees science and technology through a distinctive prism, giving him an almost unparalleled big picture view of the strengths and weaknesses of the nation's knowledge economy. While the United States remains a leader in this area, Baltimore says, other nations are gaining ground.<p>

But the solution is not to advance the field of science in the United States alone, he says. Helping other countries expand education and technology improves their economies, counters terrorism and adds to the knowledge base as well.<p> 

""A good idea is a treasure, no matter what mind conceives it,"" Baltimore said in a 2008 essay. ""The stronger world science is, the more ideas will bubble up, and the richer will be the brew of ideas and experiments that each of us can draw upon.""<p> 

Baltimore shared his views on international science development, the state of funding for U.S. R&D and the status of stem cell research, among other topics, at this Milken Institute Associates breakfast.<p>
Baltimore, who won the Nobel Prize in medicine in 1975 for his research in virology, is the Robert Andrews Millikan Professor of Biology at Caltech. He was founding director of MIT's Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, President of Rockefeller University and head of the National Institutes of Health AIDS Vaccine Research Committee. Baltimore received his Ph.D. from Rockefeller University. <p>

The United States has been at odds with Cuba since 1959, but relations are beginning to thaw under the Obama administration. This tiny island nation has been the subject of fascination, mistrust and conspiracy theories for decades. Is America ready for a new era of engagement?
<p> 
With her new book, ""Cuba: What Everyone Needs to Know,"" author Julia Sweig cuts through the rhetoric and myths to offer an authoritative and evenhanded look at Cuba's politics, its thorny relationship with the United States and its shifting role in the global community.<p> 

Sweig has toured the island's prisons, lived with Cuban families following the collapse of the Soviet Union, conducted research in government archives and interviewed hundreds of Cubans over the last two decades.<p> 

She shared her insights at a recent Milken Institute Forum, touching on issues such as human rights, the effectiveness of the isolation strategy, the U.S. presence at Guantanamo Bay, how the Castro regime survived the collapse of communism in Europe, relations with Venezuela and Cuba's future after Fidel.<p>

<p>In 2009, Torre offered a behind-the-scenes glimpse into his tumultuous stint in pinstripes in ""The Yankee Years,"" penned with legendary sports journalist Tom Verducci. New York Daily News columnist Mike Lupica proclaimed it ""one of the best books about baseball ever written.""
<p>Today Torre proudly wears Dodger blue. He has brought a steady hand to the clubhouse, guiding the team to the NLCS for two years in a row.
<p>For all his success on the field, Torre has revealed that he still bears the emotional scars of domestic violence witnessed during his childhood. Those painful experiences inspired him to reach out and help children end the cycle of violence by establishing the Safe At Home Foundation.
<p>Torre's Safe At Home Foundation provides ""safe rooms"" in schools, staffed with master-level counselors trained in domestic violence intervention and prevention. Each year, hundreds of children visit one of the eleven safe rooms located in the New York area to receive counseling and the much-needed message that ""it's not your fault"" and ""you're not alone."" Now that Torre is at the helm of the Dodgers, the Foundation is gearing up to launch similar safe rooms in Los Angeles schools this fall.

</TABLE>
Israel's economic ties to the United States are strong and growing, a relationship that benefits both nations, Israeli Ambassador Michael Oren told a select group at a special luncheon for Milken Institute supporters and staff.<p>

Oren said Israel is a bigger U.S. business partner than Russia, Argentina or Saudi Arabia, and he emphasized that the technological and scientific partnership between Israel and the United States should be recognized as an investment that has led to the creation of U.S.-based jobs. <p> 

He added that more Israeli funding is being allocated to scientific and technological collaborations with the United States, and he challenged the audience to find innovative models for financing these strategic and mutually beneficial collaborations, carried out by the Israel-U.S. Binational Industrial Research and Development Foundation (BIRD), Binational Agricultural Research and Development Fund (BARD) and Binational Science Foundation (BSF). <p>

A historian and the author of two <i>New York Times</i> best-sellers, Oren said reflecting on Israel's astonishing progress in its 62 years is both informative and reassuring. For example, Oren said, ""Israel&prime;s wine industry grew from two vineyards to 141 vineyards that now export wine to France."" <p>

Referring to the main challenges Israel is facing as its membership to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development is being considered, Oren mentioned the need to review Israel&prime;s intellectual property law as well as how it collects statistics compared to other OECD member nations. <p>

In the international realm, Oren mentioned Israel's strong agriculture-based relationship with China and its new collaborations with India. He also responded to questions about Israel's position on the Iranian nuclear option.<p>",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,2,8,2010,NULL,NULL,0,NULL,Santa Monica,NULL,1,0,NULL,1,0,0,0,0,NULL,"{length = 8, bytes = 0x0000000000240f28}",NULL,NULL,NULL,2005-10-21 10:30:22.000,2005-10-21 10:30:22.000,2010-02-08 00:00:00.000,NULL,NULL,40215,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

Parsky - the influential chairman of Aurora Capital Group, a former University of California regent and an adviser to the governor and several Republican presidents - told Milken Institute Associates at a private breakfast meeting that without ""independent thinkers"" the state cannot address its biggest challenges. <p>

Chief among those challenges, he said, is altering the current tax structure that fosters boom-and-bust revenue cycles. Tax reform was one of several goals undertaken last year by the governor&prime;s Commission on the 21st Century Economy, of which Parsky was chairman. <p>

The task force settled on a set of interrelated proposals that would reduce and simplify the personal income tax, end the corporate tax and eliminate the state sales tax. To compensate for the lost revenue, the commission recommended a business net receipts levy that would tax not only goods but also services. This would broaden the tax base, offer a more stable source of revenue and reduce dependence on the personal income tax that fluctuates with each economic boom and bust, he said. <p>

The commission issued its report in late 2009. While some reforms are appealing to Democrats and others to Republicans, Parsky said, they must be enacted in concert if they are to fix the state&prime;s financial woes. He said tax reform and the state's other big issues - including the required two-thirds vote in the Legislature to pass a budget or raise taxes, political districts drawn to favor one party over the other, and the initiative process - can't be solved by lawmakers who adhere to party lines. <p>

As the baby boomers near retirement, a growing pension crisis threatens many workers' chances of receiving the benefits they were promised by their employers. Moreover, underfunded pension liabilities also threaten the valuations of a growing number of public corporations at a time when they are facing other capital constraints.<p> 

In 2009, some 350 firms in the S&P 500 with defined benefit (DB) plans faced a funding deficit of $263 billion. The recent market downturn has sharply worsened underfunding; these companies' plans slid from being 94 percent funded in 2007 to being only 80 percent funded in 2009. Business-as-usual investment strategies are being challenged, and there is an increased risk of exposure for the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC).<p>

The Milken Institute, along with the United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW), convened a Financial Innovations Lab to explore strategies for overcoming the spiraling unfunded legacy costs of private DB plans for current and retired employees. The UFCW's David Blitzstein discussed alternative private pension plans, but pointed out that sponsoring companies will not be able to move toward a more sustainable future plan without resolving the existing unfunded liabilities.<p> 

The restructuring and settlement process of the DB system's unfunded legacy costs requires involvement from all stakeholders: plan sponsors, companies, participants, unions, the PBGC and the government. Bradley Belt, chairman of Palisades Capital Management and former executive director of the PBGC, discussed the impacts on all stakeholders, constraints of current laws and regulations, and the limitation on PBGC's ability to act (currently, the PBGC cannot negotiate/establish a revised contribution schedule with ongoing plans, though it can set the terms of repayment for a terminated plan).<p>  

A possible solution presented by economist Jeremy Gold includes a one-time move to full funding utilizing a bond swap between plan sponsors and PBGC. Participants noted that introducing PBGC bonds into capital markets would increase transparency both at plan levels and at PBGC.<p> 

Lab participants agreed that a one-size-fits-all approach simply won't work. They concluded that existing plans need to be tested and then separated into three groups:<p> 

1) The marching ahead: Unfunded liabilities for this group can be resolved using the strategy proposed by Jeremy Gold, or a similar mechanism.<br> 
2) The walking wounded: The solution for this group is to give PBGC negotiation authority, change the plan structure and share the costs of restructuring among stakeholders.<br>
3) The walking dead: The unavoidable solution for highly distressed plans is for the PBGC to work out and refinance. Participants discussed how the sharing of the cost burden could be termed out with federal support on a basis that would isolate these liabilities and mitigate further losses.<p>

Emily K. Kessler, senior fellow at the Society of Actuaries (SOA), suggested financing unfunded liabilities through industry-specific taxes. Karyn Williams, managing director at Wilshire Associates, called for more focused capital market solutions. The competitive annuity markets, private insurance, liability-driven investing strategies, dynamic portfolio management enabling duration matching, and macroeconomic aspects were also discussed.<p>

The European Union and the International Monetary Fund made a dramatic move in mid-May: They made nearly a trillion dollars in loans available to EU nations in danger of default, signaling to the world's markets that the EU is committed to such troubled countries as Greece, Portugal and Spain.<p> 
Will the rescue effort save the PIIGS and, by extension, the Eurozone? In a week when jitters sent financial markets down sharply, Komal Sri-Kumar, group managing director and chief global strategist for The TCW Group and a senior fellow at the Milken Institute, provided a private economic briefing to Milken Institute Associates, outlining the scope of the crisis and its potential for contagion.<p> 
An expert in country risk analysis, Sri-Kumar drew parallels between the evolving situation in the Eurozone and the Latin American debt crisis of the 1980s. While Greece represents only 2.5 percent of the Eurozone's GDP, its struggles have much broader implications. The markets are already beginning to test other countries where they see similarities.<p> 
It is impossible for the United States to merely watch this crisis unfold from the sidelines, according to Sri-Kumar. Both European and U.S. banks have large exposures to questionable sovereign debts, jeopardizing the still-fragile recovery. He urged a greater realization that in a tightly interconnected global economy, government officials cannot work in isolation; more coordinated international responses are required.<p> 
Sri-Kumar detailed the considerable practical difficulties of implementing the hastily unveiled bailout plan, including the political backlash in Germany. Discussion ranged from the structural origins of the crisis to prospects for rising inflation and even an eventual restructuring of the Eurozone.<p>

<p>This leading economic thinker visited the Milken Institute to discuss his new book, ""Fault Lines: How Hidden Fractures Still Threaten the World Economy,"" in which he makes his case for what caused the financial crisis and lays out what he sees as the next steps.
<p> The winner of the Fischer Black Prize for the economist under 40 who has made the most significant contributions to the theory and practice of finance, Rajan faults the financial sector and regulators - but also argues that we must examine the social inequalities that caused politicians to foster an explosion of credit, as well as the export-driven countries that count on foreign consumers to overspend.
<p>Incentives to take on risk were out of step with the dangers they posed. Instead of heavy regulation, Rajan says, the incentives for Wall Street need to change so that punishments for losing money are in line with rewards for earning it.
<p> He has suggested that the bonuses that financial workers make during boom times should be kept in escrow for a period and drained if the firm experiences big losses. He has also proposed, with two University of Chicago colleagues, a form of financial-catastrophe insurance that firms would buy into.
<p> The co-author of ""Saving Capitalism From the Capitalists,"" Rajan is a professor of finance at the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business and former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund. Rajan is also an economic adviser to the prime minister of India.

<p>The United States is standing at a crossroads on a host of monumental issues. But do we have the political will to make the difficult and perhaps unpopular decisions that will move us toward solutions? </p>
<p>
  
The need for political courage was a recurrent theme as Sen. Orrin Hatch joined the Milken Institute Associates for a private breakfast briefing. Noting that Hatch has been willing to buck his own party lines on issues like stem cell research, Institute chairman Michael Milken engaged in a wide-ranging conversation with the senator, covering everything from mobilizing the nation's domestic energy resources to free trade agreements.<p>

<p>Both Milken and Hatch are passionate advocates for spurring innovation in medical research. While reiterating that he is no fan of the recently passed health-care reform, Hatch, who has worked to triple the NIH budget, insisted that we are on the cusp of profound breakthroughs in personalized medicine. He believes that investing in cures will be the most effective way to hold down medical costs.
<p> 

The overriding concern for Hatch these days is the gaping federal deficit, which he views as unsustainable. Given the diminishing number of workers supporting entitlement programs, Washington is going to have to deal the unfunded liabilities in Social Security and Medicare. ""Sustaining the current programs is putting us deeper and deeper into debt,"" he said. But it will take bold leadership to tackle the problem.<p>

Hatch recalled his decades-long friendship with the late Sen. Ted Kennedy, a productive and genuinely collegial relationship that often resulted in legislative compromise. He bemoaned the lack of a true bipartisan spirit in Washington, calling it a ""stultifying system,"" and warned that gridlock may get even worse if centrists are voted out in favor of candidates on the far left <i>and</i> the far right. It will take compromise and great ideas from both sides of the aisle, said Hatch, to move the nation forward.<p>

Industrial biotechnology has great potential to replace plastics and a wide range of other consumer goods with more sustainably produced products. Instead of petroleum, bioplastics use agricultural products as a feedstock. The products are biodegradable, the manufacturing requires less energy, and the novel process can reduce overall demand for oil.
<p>Industrial biotechnology ventures face intense competition from petrochemical companies in the consumer goods industry. These ventures are particularly sensitive to institutional and financial barriers that prevent growth and hinder commercialization.
<p>To help industrial biotechnology ventures overcome these hurdles, the Milken Institute, in conjunction with the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Office of Energy Policy and New Uses, convened a Financial Innovations Lab. The group included top scientists and economists in academia, institutional investors, policymakers, biotech company professionals, and industry association representatives.
<p>Biological innovation has grown rapidly, and the market for environmentally friendly products is expanding. But because the initial research is so costly, these products can't compete with petroleum-based alternatives on price. Marvin Duncan, Senior Agricultural Economist at the USDA, said the industry will require increased public investment in basic R&D.
<p>Bobby Bringi, CEO of the MBI International, said strategies for reducing risk to the industry should be applied to attract private investment. He suggested bundling intellectual property and sharing its value equitably among the players in product development, the most costly stage of the process.
<p>Recurring themes at the Lab included the importance of industrial biotechnology to energy security, its ability to create jobs (especially in rural America) and the role of government in supporting this nascent industry.
<p>Among potential solutions the participants suggested are:<p>
<li> Increasing public-private partnerships in the form of shared research and product testing facilities<br>
<li> Using government to push supply and pull demand, following the model of the USDA's BioPreferred program, which assures purchases by government agencies<br>
<li> Improving the supply and reliability of government assistance<br>
<li> Exploiting the unrealized value of intellectual property to leverage financing<br>
<li> Creating technology efficacy insurance to minimize the risk of new ventures<br>
<li> Employing standardized investment bonds similar to those found in Danish investment models.

The Great Recession has had a devastating effect on state and municipal budgets throughout the United States. While an economic recovery will alleviate the cyclical components of today's crisis, tackling the structural aspects of budget shortfalls will be paramount for long-term stability within the nation's 91,000 local governmental units. Revenue/expenditure mismatches, trillions in unfunded or underfunded pension obligations, increasing longevity and the escalating cost of other post-employment benefits all need to be addressed.<p>  

The Milken Institute, along with the Kauffman Foundation, convened a Financial Innovations Lab to identify solutions. Participants included state and local government officials, union representatives, capital markets experts, money managers, academics, public-sector attorneys and representatives from bond rating agencies.<p> 

Michael Pagano, dean of the College of Urban Planning and Public Affairs at the University of Illinois, Chicago, said 2010 will mark the first time since the Great Depression that income, sales and property taxes will decline across the board. To strengthen tax receipts going forward, Pagano proposed broadening the sales tax to include services and extending the property tax to sites that are now exempt. <p>   

Changes are likely in store for public pensions as well, said Robin Prunty, managing director in the Public Finance Ratings Group at Standard & Poor's, which uses public pension funding ratios to formulate state bond ratings. Noting that more than a decade has passed since the Governmental Accounting Standards Board last revised public pension rules, Prunty predicted major modifications for public pension accounting, reporting and pension obligation funding methods. <p>  

Participants agreed that Chapter 9 bankruptcy and other pre-packaged proposals are an unappealing last resort for municipalities in distress. Henry Kevane, managing partner at Pachulski Stang Ziehl & Jones LLP, spoke from his past experience with Orange County's 1994 bankruptcy filing, calling the Chapter 9 process a costly, arduous gauntlet for municipalities. To better deal with municipalities on the verge of bankruptcy, participants suggested revisiting the concept of oversight control boards such as New York's Municipal Assistance Corporation of the 1970s, and models such as the Pennsylvania Intergovernmental Cooperation Authority. <p>   

Among the more noteworthy remedies suggested were: <p>    
<li> Adopting standardized actuarial assumptions for public pension retirement plans <br>
<li> Implementing multi-year budgeting plans for municipalities <br>  
<li> Considering economies of scale through consolidation of service providers and even municipalities themselves<br>  
<li> Revisiting the concept of rainy-day funds<br>  
<li> Using short-term federal stimulus funding to nudge states and municipalities toward long-term restructuring<p>    

Participants agreed that long-term solvency for states and municipalities will require structural, even painful paradigm shifts. But kicking the can down the road is no longer a viable option. <p>

Financial innovations can transform ideas into new technologies, industries and jobs. They can expedite medical cures, spark economic growth in the developing world, clean up the environment and help food assistance groups spend their money more efficiently. But if complex financial structures are used recklessly - as they were before the recent crisis - the consequences can be severe.  <p>

In their new book, ""Financing the Future: Market-Based Innovations for Growth,"" authors Franklin Allen and Glenn Yago trace the evolution of financial innovations and how they have advanced a variety of fields. The authors argue that the financial crisis offers a cautionary tale, but shouldn't be used as an opportunity to quash innovation altogether. They identify crucial differences between genuinely useful innovations and instruments designed merely to hide risk and generate quick profits. <p>

Allen and Yago discussed not only their book but also their views on financial reform, innovations in banking by mobile phone, and financing the development of oil substitutes, among other topics, at this Milken Institute Forum.<p>

Allen is a professor of finance and economics at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, where he has been on the faculty since 1980. The co-director of the Wharton Financial Institutions Center, Allen is also executive editor of the Review of Financial Studies.

""This country is gonna be stupid if we don't move toward using our own resources."" That was the unvarnished message from legendary oil man T. Boone Pickens, who appeared at a private breakfast meeting with the Milken Institute Associates.<p> 

""We're paying for both sides of the war,"" insisted Pickens, referring to America's heavy reliance on oil imported from unstable regions of the world.<p> 

Pickens noted that every president since Nixon has pledged to phase out oil imports, but no one has ever held their feet to the fire for failing to follow through.<p>

Today, however, Pickens believes that the discovery of new natural gas extraction methods leaves the U.S. on the cusp of a great opportunity to shift to cleaner domestically produced energy sources.<p> 

Pickens has been pressuring lawmakers into passing a revolutionary energy bill. He predicts that Senate leaders will not be able to corral the 60 votes needed to break a Republican filibuster on comprehensive energy legislation, but he remains optimistic that as elements are peeled away, the <a href=""http://www.pickensplan.com/act/"">""Pickens Plan""</a> for converting the nation's fleet of 18-wheelers to natural gas will survive and will pass with bipartisan support.<p>

In a freewheeling interview with Institute Chairman Mike Milken, Pickens discussed the geopolitical undercurrents in the oil market as well as the strategies he's used to effectively mobilize public opinion and force Washington into action.<p>

345,NULL,Associates Breakfast With David Bonderman,NULL,mia,"Wall Street financier David Bonderman is a legend in the world of private equity. His reputation is that of a trailblazer drawn to complex deals that make less confident investors balk.<p>

The trademark approach of his TPG Capital is taking on risky, distressed companies and then devoting significant resources to fixing them. One of TPG Capital's first deals was propping up Continental Airlines with $66 million, a stake that was worth $700 million just five years later. Among other well-known TPG blockbusters are Burger King and J. Crew. <p>

But in today's environment, private equity firms like Bonderman's have more cash than they have desirable deals, with an estimated $500 billion in ""dry powder"" industrywide.<p>
Bonderman will offer his take on the outlook for his industry, the economy and financial regulation during this interactive, off-the-record conversation with Milken Institute Associates. <p>
Bonderman co-founded TPG, which today has $45 billion in equity capital under management, in 1992. Before TPG, he was chief operating officer of the Robert M. Bass Group Inc., a partner in the law firm Arnold & Porter in Washington, D.C., and a civil rights attorney for the Department of Justice. A graduate of the University of Washington and Harvard Law School, the multilingual Bonderman later studied Islamic law in Cairo. <p>

Israel is in a unique position to catalyze a shift away from global oil dependence. With strong intellectual property and patenting experience, coupled with the vast expertise of its venture capital community, Israel can deploy a variety of policy and financial instruments to accelerate the development of its alternative fuel industry. This strategic decision could position Israel as a technology, innovation and financial center for the industry.<p>

Toward that end, this Financial Innovations Lab was convened to design economic models to speed the development and usage of fossil fuel substitutes. The session, held in conjunction with the National Economic Council of the Israeli Prime Minister's Office, explored specific, replicable policies and strategies to channel financial capital into alternatives to oil. The Lab focused on encouraging cross-border collaborations to develop and implement these solutions around the world.<p> 

Lab participants recommended a systematic approach to expanding the nascent industry and creating viable, competitively priced alternatives to oil. This is accomplished in part by financial incentives and regulatory support that are specific to each stage of development. By building a research consortia focused on innovations, investing in emerging technologies, and scaling up more mature products, Israel can become a global leader in the sector while creating thousands of jobs and driving economic growth.<p> 
Currently Israel's burgeoning clean-tech sector - alternative fuels, storage, wind, and solar technologies - faces a series of challenges in accessing capital. Across the innovation value chain are ""valleys of death,"" where companies become trapped and unable to move to the next level of development because the tradeoff of risk and reward is not sufficiently attractive to investors.<p> 

To bridge these valleys of death, Lab participants discussed how to best leverage public funding with private capital to scale up the overall industry. The focus is on a series of regulatory and financial mechanisms, including government incentives, funds, and public-private partnerships that would promote access to capital along every stage of the value chain.<p> 

These steps were deemed the most critical to implementation:<p>

<li> Create a tax environment that would give Israel the most favored investment status globally for fuel substitutes<br>
<li> Early stage: a prize contest and a database to develop partnerships to leverage Israeli capital<br>
<li> Mid-to-late stage: incentives to attract foreign capital, including a venture capital (VC) fund and government incentives<br>
<li> Project stage: a fuel substitute financing facility that can benefit cross-border partnerships to drive scale<p>

Are great leaders born or made?
<p>

What's the right relationship between a leader and the group?<p> 

What's the difference between a leader and a visionary?<p>

Recent failures in the financial markets and the corporate world have underscored the value of smart, effective, ethical leadership - and what can happen to an organization when it is absent.<p> 

No one is more attuned to these issues than Warren Bennis, dubbed the ""dean of leadership gurus"" by Forbes magazine. Adviser to four U.S. presidents, Bennis is the author of the seminal works ""Leaders"" and ""On Becoming a Leader."" In his latest book, ""Still Surprised: A Memoir of a Life in Leadership,"" Bennis examines the question of leadership through a highly personal lens, recounting his own experiences as a young army recruit in the Battle of the Bulge and later as a university provost during the Vietnam war protests.<p> 

Joining Bennis for this in-depth one-on-one conversation was the Milken Institute's Joel Kurtzman, an authority on management and author of the new book ""Common Purpose: How Great Leaders Get Organizations to Achieve the Extraordinary.""<p> 

These two experts explored a wide-ranging set of issues: the role of management in the financial meltdown, examples of companies with outstanding leadership and the skills needed to inspire and harness creativity in the high-tech world.<p>

 As CEO of Zappos.com, Tony Hsieh sells more than $1 billion worth of shoes and other merchandise a year. Now he's selling happiness as the cornerstone of commerce in his book ""Delivering Happiness: A Path to Profits, Passion, and Purpose.""<p>
Hsieh's philosophy is that empowered employees will result in contented customers. It seems to be working: Zappos is the largest online retailer of footwear, and for two years running, it has cracked the Top 25 on Fortune's ""best companies to work for"" list. <p>
Among the company perks are free lunches, 100 percent paid health insurance premiums and concierge services. After Amazon purchased Zappos last year for more than $1.2 billion, employees received a retention bonus equal to 40 percent of their annual salary.<p>

<p>At this Milken Institute Forum, Hsieh discussed ""Delivering Happiness,"" his views on company culture and customer service, and the reason Zappos offers new employees $2,000 to quit after they have completed their initial training.
<p>A Harvard graduate, Hsieh co-founded LinkExchange, an Internet advertising network that Microsoft purchased for $265 million in 1999.

350,NULL,Associates Breakfast With Barry Sternlicht,NULL,mia,"For investor Barry Sternlicht, history may be repeating itself.<p>
In the 1990s, during the last real estate recession, Sternlicht began building a hotel empire by purchasing distressed properties. The result was major hotelier Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, which he founded in 1995 and led for a decade. <p> 
Today, as chairman and CEO of Starwood Capital Group, he's once again snapping up bargains and amassing another major portfolio, buying distressed condos in overbuilt cities like Miami and Las Vegas as well as hotels and resorts. His recent purchase of the troubled Corus Bankshares &#151; one of the nation's largest condominium construction lenders &#151; and its real estate loan portfolio has been the talk of the industry.<p> 
At a private breakfast with the Milken Institute Associates, Sternlicht discussed the commercial real estate market and today's investing environment, which he describes as ""weird"" and ""distorted."" With government spending replacing private demand, he said, ""it's an economy on steroids.""<p>  
The key to investing, he said, is ensuring a margin of safety and fully considering the wide range of outcomes that are possible. There are lots of worrisome signs out there, including high CDS spreads of European sovereign debt, the soaring price of gold and the continued listlessness of housing market. Sternlicht commented that we might be seeing the beginnings of a tectonic reshuffling in the wealth of nations, with the balance shifting from the developed to the developing world. His portfolio is global, and while he shies away from India and Russia, he is bullish on Brazil.<p>

Despite the uncertainty hovering over the economy, Sternlicht has proven to be a master at timing the market. ""One thing you can count on for sure is population growth,"" he said, and that driver will eventually send values up.<p>

But changing human behavior is easier said than done. Can technology succeed where other approaches have failed?<p>

Raja Rajamannar, senior vice president and chief innovation and marketing officer of Humana Inc., believes it can. He will join the Milken Institute Associates for a private breakfast to discuss how new innovations in mobile technology can make a meaningful difference in health and well being.<p>  

Rajamannar argues for taking a consumer-centric approach to the problem. He will discuss new innovations being tested by Humana, including applications that can impact dietary choices by using a global-positioning satellite to find healthy dining options and tracking calorie counts, or a text-message system that delivers reminders about taking prescriptions on schedule. Video-phone connections may even serve as a way for doctors to tele-diagnose people in remote areas or simply unable to see the doctor in person.<p>

In addition to leading Humana's Innovation Center, Rajamannar heads its international businesses and its marketing, corporate communications and government relations organizations. He brought 24 years of global business management experience to Humana, including 15 years with Citigroup, where he most recently served as executive vice president and chief marketing officer of the Global Cards division. From 2006 to 2008, he managed the bank's value, cash and rewards businesses, as well as the automotive and telecommunications sectors. He also headed the new product development and new payment technologies groups. From 2003 to 2005, he was chairman and CEO of Diners Club North America. A native of India, he holds an M.B.A. from the Indian Institute of Management in Bangalore and a bachelor of technology degree in chemical engineering from Osmania University in Hyderabad.<p>

<p>Her coverage of the 2008 presidential campaign planted the seed for the book. But in the course of writing, Norris found herself unexpectedly confronting hard truths about her own family's story that had been gone unspoken by her parents &mdash; from her grandmother's work as an itinerant Aunt Jemima peddling pancake mix to her father's shooting by the Birmingham police within weeks of his discharge from service in World War II.
<p> Remarkable for its candor, ""The Grace of Silence"" is informed by interviews with ordinary Americans. At this Milken Institute Forum, Norris shared her profoundly personal story and her observations about the nation's evolving attitudes, at once encouraging and disturbing, toward race.

</TABLE>
For more than half a century, the U.S. dollar has been the world's currency, used by importers, exporters, investors, governments and central banks around the globe.
<p> 

This international dependence on the dollar is, as one observer put it, America's ""exorbitant privilege."" But today the dollar has been shaken by the effects of the financial crisis and it's being challenged by the rise of the euro and China's renminbi.<p> 

What would happen if the dollar ceases to be the world's standard currency? Would it depress American living standards and weaken the country's international influence? Noted economist Barry Eichengreen, one of the nation's foremost experts on currency issues, joined us for a Milken Institute Forum to offer his perspective on these questions.<p> 

His latest book, ""Exorbitant Privilege,"" traces the dominance of the dollar through the 20th century. But now, with the rise of China, India, Brazil and other emerging economies, America is no longer such a towering presence.<p> 

The dollar will lose its international currency status, Eichengreen warns, only if the U.S. repeats the mistakes that led to the financial crisis and if it fails to put its house in order. He believes the greenback's fate hinges not on the actions of the Chinese government but on policy decisions here in the United States.

</table>
In sub-Saharan Africa, nearly two-thirds of the population depends on farming for their livelihood. Improving agricultural productivity is the key to raising the standard of living and reducing chronic hunger.<p> 

But several factors threaten this progress. Contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP), a respiratory disease affecting cattle, is among the most serious livestock diseases in sub-Saharan Africa, imposing substantial costs on farmers and weakening the region's food security. Aflatoxin, a disease that affects maize, groundnuts and other crops, results in annual trade losses of almost a half-billion dollars and poses a real health risk.<p> 

Solutions exist for both of these problems. Improving the inconsistent vaccine manufacturing process for CBPP is clearly achievable, and aflatoxin biocontrol is being used successfully in the United States. But various challenges prevent these interventions from being applied widely and efficiently in sub-Saharan Africa.<p> 

The Milken Institute, in conjunction with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, convened two half-day Financial Innovations Labs aimed at overcoming the challenges. Participants included authorities from finance, development finance institutions, philanthropy, academia, government and NGOs, as well as scientists, manufacturers and buyers. The Labs focused on the use of ""pull mechanisms,"" whereby donors provide funding only when specified outcomes are delivered and adopted.<p>

<b>Contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP)</b><br>
<a href=""http://www.milkeninstitute.org/pdf/MIFIL362Oct7.pdf"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://www.milkeninstitute.org/events/graphics/viewslides.gif"" alt="""" name="""" width=""210"" height=""38"" border=""0"" align=""left""></a>The CBPP Lab began with the question of how to incentivize R&D and manufacturing of a better vaccine for CBPP. William Amanfu, formerly of the U.N.'s Food and Agriculture Organization, described problems with the current vaccines: They confer less than full immunity, can cause side effects in vaccinated animals and require frequent boosters. Other barriers exacerbate the issue, including difficulties with vaccine distribution and quality, deterioration of vaccines in the field, incorrect administration and a lack of data on disease incidence and vaccinations.<p> 

Developing a new vaccine would take 10 to 15 years, according to Declan McKeever, a professor at The Royal Veterinary College. Participants considered whether new technology was essential to CBPP eradication or whether alternatives - such as improving the existing vaccine, enhancing its distribution and administration, or expanding the use of antibiotics - might be more promising.<p> 

Participants concluded that a mix of solutions and funding strategies is necessary. Push funding, or upfront grants, could be used to increase tracking of disease occurrence and vaccinations. Pull mechanisms, such as price guarantees from donors, could incentivize manufacturers to produce consistently high-quality vaccines. But the Lab concluded that the economic argument for public and private involvement must be better developed.<p>

<b>Aflatoxin</b><br>
<a href=""http://www.milkeninstitute.org/pdf/MIFIL362Oct8.pdf"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://www.milkeninstitute.org/events/graphics/viewslides.gif"" alt="""" name="""" width=""210"" height=""38"" border=""0"" align=""left""></a>In the Lab session on aflatoxin, participants examined how to incentivize smallholder farmers to buy aflasafe, a biocontrol product developed in Nigeria. Ranajit Bandyopadhyay of the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture explained how aflasafe has performed successfully in trials, reducing contamination levels by 80 percent on average. Participants discussed other means of reducing aflatoxin and concluded that using biocontrol in combination with drying technologies is the best way forward. But encouraging farmers to buy biocontrol poses a challenge. Most of their crops are sold locally, where little distinction is made between contaminated and aflatoxin-free products. On the health side, the benefits are too uncertain or far into the future to be considered.
<p>

Orin Hasson of the Gates Foundation discussed how pull mechanisms might be used to encourage farmer demand for aflasafe. A pay-for-performance model, in which individual farmers are rewarded for using biocontrol in their fields or national governments are paid based on macro-indicators of aflatoxin reduction, emerged as the most promising approach. Participants discussed the next steps needed to create a pilot program, from collecting data on the extent of the aflatoxin burden in the target country to mapping out surveys and awards.<p>

363,NULL,Associates Breakfast With Beh Swan Gin <br>of the Singapore Economic Development Board,NULL,mia,"Singapore is posting a year of blockbuster growth. In fact, its government is keeping an eye on overheating - certainly a problem the United States would love to have.<p> 
What has this island nation done right, and why is it a leader in the global recovery? Beh Swan Gin, managing director of the Singapore Economic Development Board, answered those questions and more at an interactive private breakfast with the Milken Institute Associates.<p> 
One factor is Singapore's commitment to investing in human capital and public-sector R&D. A highly effective education system is producing a skilled high-tech workforce, and its manufacturing sector is expected to grow by 30 percent this year.<p> 
The biomedical sector is a particular point of pride. According to Beh, Singapore has ""attracted star scientists, but now commercialization is the challenge."" Singapore is focusing on translational research, training clinician scientists, oncology and opthamology (not surprising because, as Beh noted wryly, ""60 percent of Singaporeans wear glasses"").<p> 
In the past, Beh noted, U.S. and European firms thought of Singapore in terms of offshoring. But in the last 24 months, the relationship has changed. Today they're interested in tapping new markets.<p>
""Any CEO has to have an Asia growth strategy, and many companies are selecting Singapore for their Asian headquarters,"" said Beh, pointing to Unilever, P&G, Applied Materials and Rolls-Royce.<p> 
The financial services sector is growing as Singapore continues to attract fund managers and private banking operations. Beh noted Singapore's appeal to China's new elite and to Chinese firms seeking to go global.<p> 
Beh summed up Singapore as ""an open global city"" where 25 percent of residents are from other nations and luxury travel is on the rise. ""It's our goal to be a stop in the circuit where you build your career.""<p>

Everyone knows the first rule of real estate: Location, location, location.<p>

Today that maxim sums up the state of the nascent recovery in housing markets, according to KB Home CEO Jeffrey Mezger, who recently appeared at a private breakfast session with the Milken Institute Associates.<p> 

Housing is extremely local, he said, and we are seeing regional recoveries. In California, prime coastal communities remain strong, but just 60 miles inland, it's a different story. Texas is going strong, but Florida is ""a disaster,"" according to Mezger.<p>

He believes it will be a long time before the nation's huge shadow inventory clears, since banks have been disciplined about metering their foreclosures to avoid crashing prices.<p> 

Though Mezger sees some positive signs, including a tick upward in consumer confidence, KB Home is adapting to the new normal of slow growth. Major adjustments have been made to the firm's product offerings: Gone are the sprawling 3,500-square-foot Tuscan McMansions of 2006. Mezger says that today's consumer is getting back to value rather than maxing out on payments. To that end, the company is having great success selling 1,800-square-foot, three- and four-bedroom homes.<p> 

It's not only about the consumer scaling down. ""We decided to push the envelope on sustainability and eliminate waste,"" said Mezger. By building homes that are energy- and water-efficient, he hopes to set a new standard that will drive the entire home-building industry forward.<p>

Globalization has brought companies unprecedented opportunities to tap vast new markets. But there's a flip side: The challenges of coordinating manufacturing, sales and logistics in dozens of countries worldwide can be mind-boggling.
<p> Pierre Beaudoin, president and CEO of Bombardier Inc., knows this all too well. As the world's largest supplier of rail equipment, systems and services, and the third-largest manufacturer of civil aircraft, Bombardier employs 63,000 workers in more than 60 countries. During a private conversation with the Milken Institute Associates, Beaudoin shared his insights about doing business and capturing growth in emerging markets.
<p> Bombardier has seen a dramatic shift in global demand. Emerging markets accounted for only 11 percent of the company's sales in 2005, but today they make up over a third of new orders. 
  Beaudoin noted how quickly China is moving to build its transportation infrastructure. He saw that same decisiveness at work when Bombardier set up an extensive new factory in China: It was up and running in just 12 months.
<p> While the Canadian and U.S. governments generally take a hands-off approach to business, government has a much more direct relationship with industry in emerging markets - a reality that can both help and hinder.
<p> Most of the company's engineers are still based in Germany, but just as manufacturing went global, Beaudoin feels that multinational corporations will now have to determine the degree to which their international operations can serve as a source of product innovation and design.

</TABLE>
What does it mean to be a ""patient capitalist""?<p>

For Jacqueline Novogratz, it means using an entrepreneurial approach in the fight against global poverty.<p>
 
While traditional development aid can meet immediate needs, Novogratz believes that long-term change requires empowering local communities to solve their own problems. Charitable dollars eventually run out, but market-based approaches can continue to create jobs and economic growth over the long term.<p>
  
As founder and CEO of the Acumen Fund, Novogratz has invested in dozens of companies that provide critical goods and services in the developing world, changing the lives of millions. Acumen Fund's portfolio companies include everything from an operator of low-cost maternity hospitals to a manufacturer of anti-malarial bed nets.<p>
 
Acumen bills itself as a nonprofit global venture fund - but one that seeks to provide the poor with access to the critical goods and services they need so that they can make decisions and choices for themselves and unleash their full human potential.<p>
 
The fund starts with donations from philanthropists. But instead of making charitable grants, it uses that capital to make disciplined, patient investments in companies that offer vital services at affordable prices to low-income customers. It also applies rigorous benchmarks to evaluate the effectiveness of its investments.<p>
<img src=""http://www.milkeninstitute.org/presentations/photos/FID370Cover.gif"" alt="""" name="""" width=""154"" height=""232"" align=""left"">It's an idea that has turned heads and sparked new debate in traditional development agencies.
Acumen's success lies not only in funding life-changing services (such as clean drinking water systems in rural India) but in changing how the world addresses poverty.
<p>
 Novogratz is the author of the best-selling memoir ""The Blue Sweater: Bridging the Gap Between Rich and Poor in an Interconnected World."" In this Milken Institute Forum, she described how her past frustrations with traditional development finance led her to develop Acumen's innovative business model. She also shared some inspirational stories of how Acumen's investments are transforming lives around the world.

    <TD align=""left"" valign=""top"" class=""caption"">Gilad Erdan, Minister of Environmental Protection, opens the Lab session with an introduction of the current challenges Israel faces in improving solid waste management. </TD>
  </TR>
</TABLE>Each year, Israel generates millions of tons of waste. Given the scarcity of land and resources, the ever-growing challenge in solid waste management is coming to a head. The current landfill system is unsustainable, the overall recycling rate is less than 25 percent and efforts to change the status quo have proven ineffective to date.<p>  
Over the past two years, the Ministry of Environmental Protection has led a concentrated effort to initiate the ""solid waste revolution"" in Israel, attempting to convert a troubling environmental nuisance into a valuable asset through recycling and waste-to-energy plants. New legislation, such as the packaging law and the landfill levy, has been taken up by the Knesset. Once approved, these new regulations will generate income, creating a pool of funds for building transfer stations, treatment plants and additional infrastructure for the separation of waste at the source. Nonetheless, the revenues from these new fees are insufficient to meet the financial needs for solid waste mitigation.<p> 
Improving solid waste management requires a systematic approach to encourage cooperation from all market players. Unfortunately, there has yet to be a fully coordinated effort to approach the issue from both economic and technological perspectives. Although the new legislation defined potential sources of revenue, there are still many questions that need to be addressed in order to effectively leverage governmental funds with private capital.<p>  
The Milken Institute, in partnership with the Ministry of Environmental Protection and with support from the Richard and Rhoda Goldman Fund, convened a Financial Innovations Lab to tackle this important issue. Its goal was to identify and consolidate various sources of capital, fully leveraging public and private funds to scale up solid waste solutions. The session brought together a diverse group of scientists, financial practitioners, governmental officials, foundation executives, and technology experts to design potential models.<p> 
Participants heard presentations on specific programs in Europe, Asia and the United States,   then debated which models could be best adapted to Israel. The approaches most likely to be effective in Israel include revolving loan funds, bond banks, and pilot grants using private-public partnerships and possible bank syndications for project finance.<p> 
The Ministry has already begun promoting the ideas from the Lab to ensure that these solutions are quickly operational. Legislative language was changed to enable greater flexibility in the use of government revenues, such as loans or equity, in structured financial solutions as opposed to relying solely upon grant formulas. <p>

As an op-ed columnist for The New York Times, David Brooks gets paid to express his opinion. One of them is that Washington's general failure to find a path to political compromise is the fault of both parties.<p>

""How can you love your country if you hate the other half of it?"" Brooks asked in one recent column.<p>

Despite the entrenched political divide, Brooks detects a ""whiff of coalition-building in the air,"" pointing to negotiations on the Bush tax cuts and to the bipartisan fiscal commission process that recommended debt reductions and government reforms. <p>

At this breakfast for Milken Institute Associates, Brooks offered his informed analysis of whether Washington has the political will to fix some of the nation's biggest challenges, from entitlements to energy policy, and his predictions for what the new Congress will &#151; and won't &#151; accomplish in the coming session. <p> 

Brooks is the author of ""Bobos In Paradise: The New Upper Class and How They Got There"" and ""On Paradise Drive: How We Live Now (And Always Have) in the Future Tense"" and the editor of the 1996 anthology ""Backward and Upward: the New Conservative Writing."" A commentator on the ""PBS NewsHour,"" he also appears frequently on National Public Radio, CNN's ""Late Edition"" and ""The Diane Rehm Show.""<p> 

Previously, Brooks was a senior editor at The Weekly Standard; a contributing editor at Newsweek and Atlantic Monthly; and op-ed editor for The Wall Street Journal. His work has appeared in The New Yorker, The Washington Post, Forbes, The Public Interest and The New Republic, among many others. <p>

    <TD align=""left"" class=""caption"">Patrick O'Connor, of O'Connor NRM Pty Ltd. and the University of Adelaide, discusses mechanisms currently in place in Australia that could be replicated in Israel.

</TABLE>
Global warming has had a devastating effect on the world's biodiversity. As populations increase and the availability of open land decreases, the variety of species and habitats diminishes. This destruction threatens the health of the planet's ecosystems, affecting water quality, soil erosion and agricultural productivity.<p> 

Nowhere is this situation more apparent than in Israel, where competition for land is fierce. Population density has grown steadily over the past decade. This has led to a sharp increase in commercial and residential development. Given the country's variety of species and diverse terrain, there is an urgent need for improved conservation. Previous efforts to protect the country's environmental assets have largely been policy-based, with a focus on designating protected areas through a national parks system. This has proven ineffective in stopping the loss of biodiversity in the region.<p> 

Biodiversity, as a public good, is currently undervalued. Consequently, there has been little incentive to change market behaviors toward land use. In recent years, however, financial mechanisms have been created to sustain conservation. Payments for ecosystem services, land auctions and other compensation programs have been utilized in a variety of countries. Biodiversity banking, for example, creates opportunities for developers to trade the offsets of potential destruction while earning a profit on increasing land values.<p> 

The Milken Institute, at the request of Israel's Ministry of Environmental Protection, convened a Financial Innovations Lab to evaluate potential incentive programs and other financial mechanisms that could be used to appropriately value Israel's biodiversity. The session brought together a diverse group of scientists, capital market experts, governmental officials, foundation executives, architects and land developers to design and structure potential models.<p> 

Participants discussed how to achieve the optimal level of conservation while maintaining cost efficiency. Following presentations on specific programs in countries like the United States and Australia, participants debated which models could be most applicable to Israel. There was a focus on potential bottlenecks and barriers to the adoption of these models. Participants then suggested the creation of case studies that would further examine the feasibility of financial mechanisms to support environmental and economic growth.<p>

<i>Results from the Lab, including recommended next steps for implementation, will be published in a full report.

Filmmaker Peter Guber is an expert storyteller, responsible for such award-winning films as ""Midnight Express,"" ""The Color Purple,"" ""Gorillas in the Mist,"" ""Batman"" and ""Rain Man."" In his latest book, ""Tell to Win,"" Guber maintains that telling purposeful stories is the secret to success in not just filmmaking but in business and in life.
<p> Guber draws on research as well as his personal experiences and those of other successful people - opinion maker Arianna Huffington, YouTube founder Chad Hurley, the Dalai Lama, director Steven Spielberg, former South African President Nelson Mandela and boxer Muhammad Ali among them - to show how storytelling is the ultimate tool for motivating people and sealing deals.
<p> At this Milken Institute Forum, Guber discussed ""Tell to Win"" and described how purposeful storytelling can be the ultimate tool in persuasion.</p>

When the largest U.S. pension fund makes a move, the market listens.<p> 

With a total market value of $225 billion, CalPERS provides retirement, health and related benefits to more than 1.6 million public employees, retirees and their families. This past December, the fund announced new asset allocations, and approved a new investment classification system designed to hedge its portfolio against extreme market risks and rising inflation.<p> 

The man who will execute this strategy, Joseph Dear, shared his insights on where the markets are headed at this private breakfast with the Milken Institute Associates.<p> 

As chief investment officer of CalPERS, Dear oversees all asset classes in which CalPERS invests, including domestic and international equity, Treasury and agency debt, high-yield bonds, real estate, venture capital, leveraged buyouts and hedge funds. He is responsible for the strategic plan for the CalPERS Investment Office, including tactical asset allocation, risk management, business development, budget authority, new investment programs, trading technology, staffing and back-office operations.<p>
 
Dear joined CalPERS in 2009 after serving as executive director for the Washington State Investment Board, where he was responsible for managing more than $67.6 billion within 38 funds. He received a B.A. in political economy from The Evergreen State College in Olympia, Wash.<p>

In the information age, content is king. But as any starving writer could tell you, content creators seldom reap much profit.</p>
<p> Most of the people who produce original works through their own imagination and initiative lack the resources to lay claim to their ideas. Old-fashioned systems of patent registration have barely changed, even though intellectual capital now drives the global economy.</p>
<p> Israeli entrepreneur Shraga Biran wants to change that equation. He believes it's time to reshape intellectual property laws to reflect the realities of a brave new digital world and properly value the contributions of knowledge workers.</p>

<p>His new book, ""Opportunism: How to Change the World - One Idea at a Time,"" proposes a bold new framework that would allow anyone to register their own ideas and benefit from them financially.
<p>Biran's provocative book aims to protect the creative class. He envisions new markets that would allow writers, editors, musicians, artists, designers, engineers and inventors to own the opportunities they create as private property. Most important of all, his proposal aims to spread the wealth being generated by the digital revolution more widely and fairly.</p>

In so many areas, the demographic dividend of the baby boom is turning into a demographic deficit. Nowhere is this more accurate than in the field of health care.<p> 

The nation's 65-plus community grows by 7,000 people every day, according to a recent report from the AARP. As their medical needs escalate, so do the challenges for physicians, hospitals, and other care providers that are already working near capacity. <p>  

As senior vice president and chief strategy and corporate development officer at health insurer Humana Inc., Paul Kusserow is at the forefront of this sea change in the industry. <p>  

At this breakfast for Milken Institute Associates, Kusserow discussed the future of health care and how Humana is using innovative new approaches and strategic partnerships and acquisitions to position itself for success in a marketplace where aging will have a substantial impact. <p>

Kusserow has vast experience in the health-care industry, particularly on the financial side. He has served as managing director and chief investment officer of the Ziegler HealthVest Fund, where he focused on early-stage investments in health-care services and IT; managing director of San Ysidro Capital Partners LLC, a health-care services consulting and investment advisory firm; and senior vice president of corporate strategy and Tenet ventures at Tenet Healthcare Corp. <p>

Prior to joining Humana, Kusserow was managing director of private equity at the Chicago-based investment firm B.C. Ziegler and Co. He has also worked as an executive in strategic planning, new business development, M&A and marketing capacities at National Geographic and Reader's Digest, and as a management consultant at McKinsey & Co. Kusserow is a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Wesleyan University and received an M.A. with honors from Oxford University, where he was a Rhodes Scholar. <p>

</TABLE>

When it comes to implementing federal health-care reforms, the devil is in the details. While Congress laid out the broad strokes of health reform, it's the states that must turn those policies into practice.
<p> At the first in a series of Milken Institute Forums on health care, two Californians with vast knowledge of the state's health-care system tackled the fine points and challenges of moving the process forward. Susan Kennedy, former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger's chief of staff and his appointee to the state's Health Benefit Exchange Board, and Richard Merkin, CEO of the Heritage Provider Network, had a high-level discussion of the pitfalls and promises of health reform.
<p> At the federal level, the issues are many. The legislation will likely continue to evolve, given the makeup of Congress and the president's apparent willingness to negotiate around the edges. It puts huge unfunded mandates on the states at a time those governments can ill afford them, so pushback and demands for relief are likely.
<p> California and other states face big challenges in implementing the provisions. With more people insured or eligible for Medi-Cal, providers' rates could skyrocket as they are inundated with new patients. Explaining the reforms to the consumer will be key, as is managing the political expectations of those on both sides of the issue.
<p> Kennedy is in the thick of it as a board member of what could be the country's largest health exchange - the mechanism that will allow consumers in each state to comparison-shop for coverage. The health exchange board must clarify whether the goal is expanding coverage or bringing down costs, then design an efficient enrollment portal that takes political realities into account.
<p> Kennedy is a veteran of two major health-care reform efforts. As deputy chief of staff, she helped lead Gov. Gray Davis' 1999 campaign for comprehensive HMO reform in the state and Schwarzenegger's 2007 initiative, which contained many of the same elements as the federal health reform program.
<p> Merkin, who earned his M.D. at the University of Miami, is a pioneer in the development of medical networks. The founder of Heritage Provider Networks, he has spent the past 30 years implementing a successful business model to address the needs and challenges of affordable managed care.

Unrest in the Middle East is raising prices and restricting the supply of oil to Israel and the rest of the world. While heavy oil, kerosene and coal are helping to offset the pressure in the near term, Israel is also taking a long-term approach, according to Minister of National Infrastructure Uzi Landau.<p>

At this breakfast meeting hosted by the Milken Institute Israel Center, Landau detailed Israel&prime;s strategy for meeting the challenges of energy and water supplies, and explained what elements make Israel attractive to investors in the relevant technologies.<p>  

Israel intends to develop revolutionary energy technologies with the support of its renowned universities, advanced research and development resources, well-developed banking system, and highly evolved insurance sector, Landau said. This national strategy was developed at a Milken Institute Financial Innovations Lab on fuel alternatives that resulted in the government&prime;s recent decision to allocate more than $400 million to alternative fuels and channel $3.9 billion into the task of ending oil dependency.<p>

In the next decade, Israel will invest $40 billion in conventional energy resources, paying special attention to Israel&prime;s newly discovered natural gas reserves, Landau said. While natural gas is valuable for electric power generation, it can also act as an alternative to imported transportation fuels and as feedstock for industrial chemicals.<p> 

Israel aims to invest $4 billion to increase the proportion of renewable energy to 10 percent of all power generation. Most of the investment will go to solar energy, Landau said, but also to wind and biomass technologies, including turning liquefied natural gas (LNG) and agricultural biomass into methanol, a transportation fuel. The minister&prime;s vision also includes increasing energy efficiency by 20 percent as soon as 2020.<p>

To develop its energy-efficiency goals, Israel works with U.S. researchers on an academic level to share technologies and innovations in energy efficiency and oil replacement, Landau said. In partnership with the Milken Institute, Israel continues to expand cooperative research with the U.S.<p>

  </TR>
  </TABLE>
Israel is anticipating a dramatic surge in income from foreign exchange reserves from high-tech exports and the massive natural gas fields that were recently discovered. This capital flow could quickly increase foreign exchange reserves and strengthen the shekel, creating undesirable economic side effects. <p> 
The billions of dollars in potential revenue could lead to drastic currency appreciation that would threaten the competitiveness of the country's export sector while building inflationary pressures domestically.<p>
Many resource-rich countries - from Norway to Singapore and South Korea - have created national sovereign wealth funds (state-owned sovereign investment funds) to invest revenues globally as a way of moderating inflation risks and creating an effective investment mechanism for national economic development. In fact, the total assets under management of sovereign wealth funds exceed $4 trillion, far more than private equity and hedge funds in the global financial markets.<p> 
Sovereign wealth funds are not a homogeneous group with a shared goal. They are driven by different objectives that include fiscal stability, internal development, future savings and increasing returns on foreign exchange reserves. Based on its objective, each fund holds a different position in the spectrum of risk tolerance and uses different investment strategies.
<p> 
The Milken Institute, at the request of Israel's National Economic Council, conducted a Financial Innovations Lab to discuss and map potential designs for an Israeli fund, including its legal structure, governance framework and investment strategy. The session brought together a diverse group of policymakers, scholars, investment fund executives, financial industry and sovereign wealth fund advisors, and representatives from NGOs for practical advice on how to structure the fund and address pot	ential challenges.<p> 
Experience shows that in some countries these funds have been compromised by political pressures and require more effective corporate governance. Participants examined various best practices to ensure adequate governance and asset management with the goal of carving out new channels of capital for savings and investment in Israel's dynamic economy while avoiding inflationary pressures. Additionally, Lab participants examined trade-offs between investment vs. sovereign debt retirement or restructuring. The Lab reviewed methods for allocating gas revenues toward investment or debt retirement.<p>  
After presentations on Israel's macroeconomic condition, participants debated the purpose of an Israeli fund and examined its potential to further enhance and secure national retirement insurance. The group suggested that Israel establish as soon as possible a small fund that can be expanded later. A benchmark rate of return was also discussed, and participants agreed that revenue could be spent domestically on improving human capital and security once return thresholds were achieved.<p>

For almost three years, Steven Levy attended high-level meetings of Google executives, spent time with engineering teams as they developed projects, and ate in the free cafes on the Googleplex, a mathematical term for an inconceivably large number that is also the nickname of Google's campus.
<p> The result of this immersion is Levy's latest book, ""In the Plex: How Google Thinks, Works and Shapes Our Lives,"" detailing the success - and the missteps - of arguably the most important and forward-looking company in the world.
<p> At this Milken Institute Forum, Levy gave his take on the latest twists and turns in Google's story, including:<p> 
<li> The cat-and-mouse games between the Chinese government and Google before it withdrew from the country, the tension between Google's executives in Mountain View and its employees in Beijing, and the fallout after Chinese hackers penetrated Google's digital vaults and exposed Chinese dissidents using Gmail.<p>
<li> The intense debate over Google's effort to digitize the world's books and a judge's decision in March to reject Google's allegedly one-sided copyright settlement with authors and publishers.<p> <li> The company's struggles with difficult issues like keeping user information, tracking users on the Internet, and the gathering of Wi-Fi information via the company's Street View collection process.<p>
<li> The unconventional style of Larry Page, who just became Google's CEO for a second time, as well as his colorful co-founder, Sergey Brin.

<p>It's a story that Levy is infinitely qualified to tell. Now a senior writer at Wired magazine, Levy has covered technology since 1981 for such publications as Rolling Stone, The New Yorker and The New York Times. He was a senior editor and chief technology writer at Newsweek and is the author of several books, among them ""The Perfect Thing: How the iPod Shuffles Commerce, Culture and Coolness,"" ""Hackers"" and ""Insanely Great.""

<p> To help bridge this funding gap, dozens of investors and innovators convened for a Financial Innovations Lab to explore the approaches being used to advance initiatives in medicine and other industries. Organized by <i>FasterCures</i> and the Milken Institute, the Lab was designed to explore whether these financial tools could be applied to translational medical research.
<p> The Lab spotlighted models for partnering in research and development, and identified finance instruments and incentives, some of which are described below.
<p>
<li> The ""distributed partnering model"" utilizes product definition companies (PDCs) that identify and license promising early-stage assets from research institutes, manage product definition research, and sell de-risked assets to later-stage stakeholders. The PDCs make $3 million to $5 million investments aimed at attracting additional funding.
  <p>
<li> BioPontis Alliance is a hybrid investment fund and product development company that aggregates technologies from a consortium of universities. It screens these assets, develops them through a translational development network and then licenses them to strategic pharmaceutical partners. Its activities are supported by a $50 million fund. The model encourages sourcing of early-stage assets from academia by pooling and sharing the value of intellectual property, and helps ensure later-stage funding by establishing relationships with pharmaceutical companies. This proposition is made more attractive to universities via a master IP licensing agreement that expedites the process and grants universities a pro-rata share of the total value created by the assets.
  <p>
<li> Fast Forward, a wholly owned subsidiary of the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, represents a new venture philanthropy model. It provides leveraged, philanthropic funding to translate academic research and further develop biotech research into new treatments. The technologies are identified and evaluated by scientific and business advisors. Fast Forward makes investments in the range of $250,000 to $1 million.
  <p>
<li> The Israeli Life Sciences Fund uses a standard venture capital-structured fund with the government and the private sector as limited partners. The Israeli government, which takes the first loss before the other limited partners, has committed $80 million to boost returns for private investors.
  <p>
<li> Flow-through shares, which originated in the Canadian resource industry, encourage higher-risk investments through tax incentives. Oil and mineral exploration companies issue these shares as a way to pass government tax deductions for exploration on to investors, effectively halving the risk of investment.
  <p> There was broad agreement that the medical research system has much to learn from financial models that have worked in other industries such as filmmaking, telecommunications, and oil and gas. But participants cautioned against simplistic analogies, noting the unique circumstances that define the medical research process. Science is unpredictable, and failure to fully vet a product has consequences that are measured in terms of life or death.

</TABLE>
The lower Rio Grande valley of Texas, encompassing four counties on the U.S.-Mexican border, is plagued by high unemployment, low wages and limited access to decent housing. The region's 1.3 million people face poverty and limited opportunities for entrepreneurship. Banks and other financial institutions have traditionally been reluctant to lend to the valley's residents, many of whom lack real assets and have poor credit scores. Whether they are looking to purchase a new home, retrofit an existing structure or start a small business, residents of these underbanked communities face a significant hurdle in trying to tap the capital markets.
<p> To address the region's access to capital, the Milken Institute, in conjunction with the Ford Foundation, convened a group of community development organizations, investors, government leaders, academics and private-sector practitioners. Other participants included the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Community Development Corporation of Brownsville, the University of Texas Pan American, Homewise, EDCO Ventures, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and many other engaged organizations. Their representatives discussed incentives and models to re-engage the capital markets in lending to valley residents, promoting economic growth and job creation.
<p> The Ford Foundation, which has a strong history of investment in social development, gave an overview of its long-term goals for the region: creating living-wage jobs and developing housing, transportation and land-use opportunities. They hope to achieve these aims by bringing together regional stakeholders to work together to remove barriers to development.
<p> Because Lab participants represented a diverse set of interests in the lower Rio Grande valley, much of the conversation focused on how development efforts could become less fragmented and more unified. Currently, most of the innovative community development projects operate in independent silos; there is no comprehensive valley-wide initiative in place to coordinate the key stakeholders.
<p> The Lab served as a useful platform for launching a more holistic development plan. Tangible next steps were identified, including the creation of a new valley council that will coordinate various group efforts, as well as other related policy and economic recommendations to leverage public incentives to create more attractive lending policies.

You're frazzled. You're stressed out. And you imagine that a long, lazy vacation will be the perfect medicine for what ails you.
<p> Well, snap out of it.
<p> Author Todd Buchholz is here to tell you that escaping the overscheduled daily grind to enjoy some down time won't make you happy at all. He maintains that what you really want is to chase your tail, even if you never catch it. In fact, peace and quiet will ruin your state of mind. He concludes that the race to compete has not only made us smarter - it's what we fundamentally need.
<p> At this Milken Institute Forum, Buchholz discussed his provocative new book, ""Rush,"" which was named one of the top 10 titles for 2011 by Publishers Weekly. Witty, compelling and full of surprises, it argues that the race itself delivers a rush and drives us forward, even if we never reach the finish line. Buchholz builds his case by weaving together entertaining stories and counterintuitive arguments gleaned from neuroeconomics, evolutionary biology, Renaissance art and General Motors.
<p> Among his arguments:<p>

<p>The U.S. economy seems to be sinking under the weight of the past decade's debt binge. Today the focus is simply on keeping us afloat, but what we really need is a long-term plan for sustaining growth by creating millions of new jobs.
<p> It's time for an American renaissance - and it starts with innovation.
<p> In ""The Comeback,"" Gary Shapiro - who runs the world's largest consumer technology show - argues that it's time to return innovation to its rightful place at the center of America's economic policy. Sustainable job growth will come only from creative minds designing cutting-edge products they can export around the globe and from entrepreneurs who will launch the next Google or Apple.
<p> At this Milken Institute Forum, Shapiro discussed how to provide the best and the brightest with the encouragement and incentives they need to follow their entrepreneurial dreams.

We bank online. We shop online. We date, learn, work and live online. But the institutions that keep us safe in the brick-and-mortar world don't always know how to protect us in a digital world without borders.
<p> In fact, governments and the private sector are losing billions of dollars a year fighting a clever new breed of criminal. Their efforts are made even harder since the enemy is shadowy and constantly morphing.
<p> Misha Glenny has traveled the world speaking with members of military and intelligence communities, police, politicians, lawyers, and - most important - with hackers and their victims. His new book, ""DarkMarket: Cyberthieves, Cybercops and You"" delves beneath the sheer audacity of these 21st-century criminals to reveal their personalities and what makes them tick. In this Milken Institute Forum, he offered surprising suggestions for how governments, the private sector and individuals should respond to the current epidemic of cybercrime.
<p> A former BBC Central Europe correspondent, Glenny is the author of the international best-seller ""McMafia: A Journey Through the Global Criminal Underworld."" His other books include ""The Rebirth of History: Eastern Europe in the Age of Democracy,"" ""The Fall of Yugoslavia: The Third Balkan War"" (winner of the Overseas Press Club Award in 1993 for Best Book on Foreign Affairs), and ""The Balkans: Nationalism, War, and The Great Powers, 1804-1999.""

402,NULL,Taking Liberties: The War on Terror and the Erosion of Democracy,NULL,Forums,"
<p>Perhaps the greatest casualty of the ""War on Terror"" has been the U.S. Constitution, as long-cherished civil liberties have been tossed aside in the name of national security. That's the premise of ""Taking Liberties,"" a new book by ACLU president Susan Herman. </p>
<p> Herman maintains that a decade after 9/11, it's far from clear that the government's hastily adopted antiterrorist tactics (such as the Patriot Act) are keeping us safe. But there's no denying that these emergency measures have ruined the lives of many ordinary Americans who have been caught up in the government's dragnet, often by mistake.
<p>Activities that should be protected by the First Amendment can now lead to prosecution. Blacklists and watchlists keep people grounded at airports even though they're rife with errors that cannot be challenged. National Security Letters allow the FBI to demand records about innocent people from libraries, financial institutions and Internet service providers without ever going to court. Government databanks brim with information about every aspect of our private lives.
<p> But not everyone agrees about the dangers posed by the post-9/11 surveillance regime. Many would argue that the realities of keeping terrorists at bay trump individual liberties.
<p> Are the bedrock principles of American democracy being eroded? Join us as ""Taking Liberties"" author Susan Herman squares off with legal scholar John Eastman in a lively debate. This event will be moderated by the Milken Institute's senior managing director and COO, Paul Irving (former co-chairman, chief executive and managing partner at the national law firm of Manatt, Phelps & Phillips).

During his two years as budget director, Peter Orszag played a key role in some of the Obama administration's most significant initiatives.<p>

Today, he has a much different role as vice chairman of global banking for Citigroup. <p>

At this intimate breakfast for Milken Institute Associates - our very first to be held in New York City - Dr. Orszag gave his informed analysis of what the future may hold for the economy, the markets and the Beltway, followed by a Q&A with participants. Few people are better qualified to offer an insightful assessment of these issues. <p>

Prior to joining the administration, Orszag was the director of the Congressional Budget Office, which provides objective analyses of economic and budgetary issues. Before joining the CBO, he was the Joseph A. Pechman Senior Fellow and deputy director of economic studies at the Brookings Institution. During the Clinton administration, Orszag held several positions, including special assistant to the president for economic policy and senior economist for the President's Council of Economic Advisers. Orszag also founded and subsequently sold an economics consulting firm. <p>

A contributor to Bloomberg News and former columnist at The New York Times, Orszag has co-authored or co-edited a number of books, most recently ""Protecting the Homeland."" He is an adjunct senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and a member of the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies of Sciences. A summa cum laude graduate of Princeton University, Orszag holds a Ph.D. in economics from the London School of Economics, where he was a Marshall Scholar. <p>

He is one of basketball's towering figures. Now, for the first time, Jerry West tells his own story in a compelling new autobiography that is unsparing in its self-assessment and honesty.
<p> ""West by West"" chronicles his journey from a tough upbringing in the mining town of Chelyan, West Virginia, all the way to the NCAA Finals, the top of the Olympic podium and the NBA championships. West candidly reveals the personal adversity he has faced along the way, including physical abuse, the death of a brother and his ongoing battle with depression.
<p> In this special Milken Institute Forum, acclaimed sportscaster Jim Gray interviewed West about his remarkable life on and off the court, including his 40-year career with the Lakers. ""Mr. Clutch"" recounted the highlights of his storied 14-year playing career and how as general manager, he guided the Lakers through one of the greatest decades in sports history.
<p> <b>Jerry West</b> was a 14-time NBA All-Star. During his brilliant career with the Lakers, he led the team in scoring seven times and becoming only the third player in league history to surpass the 25,000-point plateau. During his 19-year stint as both general manager and executive vice president, the Lakers captured four NBA championships and made eight trips to the NBA Finals. West attended West Virginia University, where he was a two-time All-American, and co-captained the gold medal-winning 1960 U.S. Olympic basketball team.
<p> <b>Jim Gray</b> has been a network television and national cable sportscaster since 1983. His career highlights include live TV or radio broadcasts of nine Olympic Games, 21 Super Bowls, nine World Series, 19 NBA Finals, 13 NCAA Final Fours, 20 Master's tournaments and hundreds of championship boxing matches.

As minister of natural resources for Canada, Joe Oliver shapes policy for the largest supplier of energy to the United States. This puts him at the nexus of America's efforts toward establishing lasting energy security.<p>
Canada ranks third in proven oil reserves behind Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, and the U.S. is its biggest - and virtually only - customer. That relationship will become even more co-dependent if a proposed $7 billion Keystone XL pipeline is built from Canada through the American heartland. <p>
At this breakfast for Milken Institute Associates, this important decision-maker gave his take on:
<ul>
  <li>
    What the U.S. and Canada are doing right when it comes to energy security, and how North America can further distance itself from hostile oil-producing nations.<br> 
  </li>
  <li>The risks and rewards of the 1,700-mile Keystone pipeline that, if approved, would carry Canadian oil sands from Alberta to Texas through six U.S. states. (The risks are environmental, and the rewards involve as many as 20,000 U.S. jobs and almost $100 million in state and local tax revenues for each of the six states.)<br>
  </li-
  <li>The pros and cons of oil sand - the source of roughly half Canada's oil production.<br>
  </li>
  <li>The debate among our neighbors to the north over whether the almost exclusive trading relationship with the United States is really in Canada's best interests.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
Oliver, who was elected to the House of Commons in May and named natural resources minister that same month, was an investment banker prior to this election. Previously, he served as executive director of the Ontario Securities Commission and president and CEO of the Investment Dealers Association of Canada. A graduate of the Directors Education Program at the Rotman School of Management, he was also a member of the Canadian Institute of Chartered Business Valuators and a board member of the Canadian Securities Institute Research Foundation.<p> Oliver is active in several charities and serves as chair of the Prostate Cancer Research Foundation of Canada. A member of the Quebec Bar, he received a B.A. and Bachelor of Civil Law from McGill University and an MBA from the Harvard Graduate School of Business.<p>

406,NULL,The Milken Institute Lake Tahoe Retreat: Accelerating Innovation in the Bioscience Revolution,NULL,Forums,"The promise of medical science has never appeared greater. A new era of personalized medicine could assure greater longevity and quality of life. But realizing that vision is proving tougher and taking longer than anyone imagined. Progress has bogged down in the face of financing, regulatory and structural hurdles. With lives in the balance, how can we shake up the status quo? Is there a better way to conduct medical research in the 21st century? <p> 

In short, how can we accelerate innovation? <p>

Answering those questions was the primary focus of this high-level retreat in Lake Tahoe, Nevada. This invitation-only event gathered some of the leading minds in medicine to challenge the notion of business as usual and take an entirely fresh approach to jumpstarting innovation in research and development. <p>

At this intensive retreat, disruptive innovators from a range of industries and disciplines met with scientists, regulators, biopharmaceutical executives, policy experts, philanthropists and patient advocates. We believe that the medical research community can benefit from examining what works in other fields. Together they laid out concrete next steps that can result in better patient outcomes and lower costs. <p>

The agenda touched on such issues as: <p>

&bull;How do we overcome a culture of risk aversion? <p>
&bull;What innovative models already exist in different disease research areas? Are they broadly applicable? <p>
&bull;How do we encourage capital formation around innovation when the risk of failure is high? <p>
&bull;What's the right model for information-sharing and convergence? <p>
&bull;What kind of next-generation intellectual property protections and research incentives do we need? <p>
&bull;How do we make sure that the regulatory process keeps up with the pace of science, especially as we move toward personalized medicine? <p>
&bull;Is there a better way to conduct clinical trials? <p>

Abu Dhabi has been amassing high-profile international assets, from the Manchester City soccer club to New York's Chrysler Building and a stake in London's Gatwick Airport.<p>  
 
But today the UAE faces unprecedented challenges: fluctuating oil prices, a deflating property market, strained infrastructure, rising unemployment in the northern emirates and growing calls for democratic reforms.<p>  

As the brand-new U.S. ambassador to the UAE, Michael Corbin is in a unique position to understand the opportunities and challenges that lie ahead. He shared his insights during an interactive conversation with the Milken Institute Associates, including his observations about the U.S.-UAE relationship, economic partnership opportunities for the business community and the political changes sweeping the entire Middle East. <p>
 
Michael Corbin was sworn in as the U.S. ambassador to the United Arab Emirates in July. He most recently served as deputy assistant secretary of state in the Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs. Prior to this assignment, he was minister-counselor for political-military affairs at the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad from 2008 to 2009 and charge d'affaires at the U.S. Embassy in Damascus from 2006 to 2008. He has also served as minister-counselor for economic and political affairs at the U.S. Embassy in Cairo; deputy director of the Office of Arabian Peninsula Affairs in the Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs; director of the Counter-Narcotics Section at the U.S. Embassy in Caracas. His first overseas post was at the U.S. Embassy in Kuwait from 1987 to 1989. Prior to joining the foreign service, Corbin served in the Peace Corps in Mauritania.<p>

Victor DeNoble, a research scientist at Philip Morris in the 1980s, was supposed to create a safer cigarette. In the end, he created a firestorm of controversy for the tobacco industry after discovering scientific evidence that nicotine was addictive.
<p>""Addiction Incorporated,"" a new documentary by director Charles Evans Jr., tells the fascinating tale of DeNoble's path from principled scientist to intrepid whistleblower. The film recounts DeNoble's testimony before Congress - and the heads of seven major tobacco companies declaring under oath that they believed nicotine was not addictive - that helped trigger the first federal regulation of the tobacco industry.
<p>The documentary was screened at an invitation-only Milken Institute Forum shortly before opening in Los Angeles on January 13.

But since government budgets are shrinking and the financial sector is increasingly risk averse, what will jumpstart economic growth? And what types of innovative investment products can help?<p>   
 
One answer - supported by economists on both sides of the aisle - is to scale up both public and private funding for infrastructure development. The energy sector, for example, could benefit from substantial investment. There are currently huge unmet needs, from updating the nation's aging electricity grid to creating improved distribution networks for renewable products. But the right government incentives must be structured to deliver financing at the right times to the right companies.<p>  
To address the challenges in financing energy infrastructure, the Milken Institute, in conjunction with the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Office of Energy Policy and New Uses, convened a group of energy experts, financial and corporate investors, bankers, scientists, technologists, U.S. government representatives and researchers from national laboratories.<p> 
Participants discussed successful models of infrastructure finance that could be replicated in the U.S. energy sector, from the debt and equity products offered by the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) to the structured and project finance mechanisms leveraged by the Export-Import Bank, to successful programs run by state governments. Learning from best practices in other industries and regions, these mechanisms would facilitate long-term, low-cost financing for energy infrastructure development, impacting rural communities and urban areas alike.<p>
The Lab served as a useful platform to refine new and existing investment models as well as credit enhancements and other risk-mitigation tools that can be deployed to finance large-scale infrastructure projects. The session examined how each model could impact the entire value chain, noting that each stage of technology innovation has specific financing needs.<p>
Following the Lab, participants reconvened for smaller working sessions to further explore potential models and products discussed during the initial session. Ideas suggested included a green bank and a one-stop financing facility.<p>
<i>Results from the Lab, including recommended next steps for implementation, can be found <a href=""http://www.milkeninstitute.org/publications/publications.taf?function=detail&ID=38801377&cat=finlab"">here</a>.

It takes a streak of steely determination to challenge the status quo - and no one knows that better than Connie Rice, one of America's most renowned civil rights attorneys. Her new book, <b>""Power Concedes Nothing: One Woman's Quest for Social Justice in America, from the Courtoom to the Kill Zones,""</b> reveals the inspiring life of an indomitable woman. (Click <a href=""http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/books/la-ca-connie-rice-20120108,0,7022777.story"">here</a> for the L.A. Times review.)
<p> Rice's race for excellence began at home: Her father broke racial barriers as a U.S. Air Force major, and her mother imbued her with a passion for learning and culture. Her worldview was shaped by moving to 17 different homes during her childhood, including periods in England and Japan. After college at Harvard and law school at NYU, where she spent summers working on high-profile death penalty litigation for the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund, Rice began the work that would win her national acclaim for her stirring defense of civil rights.

<p> Over the course of her career, the ""Lady Lawyer"" (as Rice would come to be known to the Los Angeles gang members with whom she struck a pioneering partnership) would take on racism and sexism in the LAPD, a transit system that tried to ignore its poorest users, and a public school system that Rice and her cohorts deemed inadequate. But she is perhaps best known for the report she co-wrote that has revolutionized the city's law enforcement policies and outreach to gangs.
<p> Her constant involvement with the LAPD ultimately yielded the consummate reward: her very own parking space at headquarters. LAPD Chief Charlie Beck calls Rice ""the conscience of the city.""

Such straight-forward advice - and his prescient investing - have made Marks a legend on Wall Street. The chairman of Oaktree Capital Management, Marks writes regular client newsletters about market opportunity and risk that have almost a cult following for their insightful commentary and time-tested philosophy. Now Marks has written a book, ""The Most Important Thing: Uncommon Sense for the Thoughtful Investor,"" based on his 40 years in the field.<br><br>

Even the Oracle of Omaha follows Marks' missives. ""When I see memos from Howard Marks in my mail, they're the first thing I open and read,"" says Berkshire Hathaway's Warren Buffet. ""I always learn something, and that goes double for his book."" <br><br>

At this Milken Institute Forum, Marks took the stage with Institute Chairman Mike Milken in a conversation about ""The Most Important Thing,"" the state of today's markets, the economy and other topics.<br><br>

Marks co-founded Los Angeles-based Oaktree, one of the largest hedge-fund managers in the world with roughly $80 billion under management, in 1995. Oaktree was one of nine investor groups tapped by the U.S. government in March 2009 to soak up toxic debt from troubled banks under the Public-Private Investment Plan. <br><br>

 Before establishing Oaktree, Marks led investments in distressed debt, high-yield bonds and convertible securities at TCW Group and also served as chief investment officer for domestic fixed income. Previously, he spent 16 years at Citicorp Investment Management in various roles, including vice president and senior portfolio manager for convertible and high-yield securities. Prior to that, he was director of research at Citicorp.

<p>The recent financial crisis was an accident, a perfect storm fueled by an unforeseeable confluence of events that collided and brought down the global financial system. And policymakers? They did everything they could, given their limited authority.</p>
<p>At least that's the story that's been fed to the American people.</p>
<p>But economists and regulatory experts James Barth and Ross Levine are here to debunk that version of events. In a provocative new book, they argue that the financial meltdown was no accident. It was negligent homicide.</p>

<p>In ""Guardians of Finance"" (written with Williams College economist Gerard Caprio), Barth and Levine show that senior regulatory officials around the world knew (or should have known) that their policies were destabilizing the global financial system. They had years to process the evidence that risks were rising and the authority to change their policies - but they chose not to act until it was too late.</p>
<p>Barth and Levine maintain that the current system is simply not designed to work on behalf of average citizens. It is virtually impossible for the public and its elected officials to make an informed and impartial assessment of financial regulation and to hold regulators accountable.</p>
<p>But there's a potential solution at hand: the establishment of a ""Sentinel"" empowered to demand information and evaluate it in terms of the public interest - rather than that of the financial industry, the regulators or politicians.</p>

Eike Batista hopes his success story will inspire a new generation of Brazilian entrepreneurs and eventually transform the country, both socially and economically. ""We don't need to only have the best soccer players in the world,"" he said recently. ""Why not have the best entrepreneurs in the world?"" <p>

Recently named one of the 50 most influential people on the planet by Bloomberg Businessweek, the billionaire Batista feels a responsibility to help fellow Brazilians improve their quality of life. He helps fund a police program to eradicate drug gangs from the slums, and he has pledged millions more toward the 2016 Summer Olympics that will put the country in the international spotlight. <p>

At this private breakfast for Milken Institute Associates, Batista gave his take on how to solve Brazil's social challenges, what's ahead for the commodities and metals market, and what is being done to improve infrastructure to handle not only Brazil's sizzling economic expansion but also the influx of visitors for the Olympics and 2014 World Cup.<p>

Batista is also contributing to the infrastructure boom, building a $2 billion ""superport"" in Rio that will handle some 350 million tons of imports and exports a year, including crude from the gigantic Brazilian oil discovery that he has called a ""trillion-dollar story."" <p> 

Batista is chairman and CEO of the EBX Group, a holding company for a number of subsidiary firms focused on mining, energy, oil and gas, logistics and offshore exploration. EBX companies have built ports, power plants and drilling operations, as well as hospitality and entertainment projects in Rio de Janeiro. Batista, who was a world champion powerboat racer, engages regularly with his more than 550,000 Twitter followers. <p>

What are consumers thinking? No one knows better than Peter Lowy, CEO of the Westfield Group.<p>

Named one of the 100 Best-Performing CEOs in the World by the Harvard Business Review, Lowy leads the biggest operator of shopping centers on the globe. With 124 centers in the U.S., U.K., Australia and New Zealand, Lowy has his ear to the ground when it comes to retail and real estate trends. <p>

At this breakfast for Milken Institute Associates, Lowy gave his take on what's ahead for retail, how the commercial real estate market is shaping up, the future of the U.S. economy and a host of other issues. <p>

Lowy has spent 28 years in the retail and REIT industry, joining Westfield Group in 1983 and becoming a managing director in 1997. Last year he and his brother Steven took the reins at Westfield as patriarch Frank Lowy stepped down and assumed the role of nonexecutive chairman. <p> 

Westfield is expanding its presence with new ventures in Brazil and Italy - its first new markets since 2000. But Lowy has expressed caution about further growth: ""History is littered with companies rushing into new markets overseas without doing their homework. We're not running to open new markets until we can see the real investment returns."" <p>

Before the Westfield Group, Lowy worked in investment banking in London and New York. He sits on the boards of the Lowy Institute for International Policy in Australia, the RAND Corp. and the Homeland Security Advisory Council as well as the Executive Committee of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. Now a resident of Los Angeles and a U.S. citizen, Lowy holds a bachelor's degree from the University of New South Wales, Australia. <p>

The practical applications of the Internet &mdash; the ability to borrow money, invest in the stock market or buy a new home &mdash; have made it a force unequaled in scope and impact on our daily lives. But it's taken on a momentum of its own. In fact, Bill Davidow, the author of ""Overconnected,"" argues that it was the root cause of the recent financial meltdown from which the world is still struggling to recover.
<p> How did it happen? How did the skein of interconnections we are living with grow so tangled? How is it that the same technology that allows us to pay our bills online makes us fear that our identity will be stolen? How did the very network that allows families to go online to shop for a house and a mortgage also become the conduit for a series of transactions that would eventually cause them to lose the house and default on the mortgage?
<p> In this Milken Institute Forum in Santa Monica, Davidow offers practical advice on how to utilize the benefits of the Internet while curbing its hazards. ""One of the pioneers of modern technology shows how the unanticipated effects of the Internet are distorting economics, politics, international relations and individual lives,"" says James Fallows of The Atlantic.
<p> ""The new environment is filled with opportunity,"" Davidow says, ""but whether we seize it or let it hold us hostage is our decision to make.""
<p> ""Overconnected"" will be for sale at the Forum, and Davidow will be available to sign copies.
<p> <b>Bill Davidow</b> has been a high-tech industry executive and venture capital investor for more than 30 years. He is an active advisor to Mohr-Davidow Ventures, a Silicon Valley VC firm that he co-founded in 1985. Since then, the firm has helped to build more than 250 startup companies. Davidow joined Intel in 1973, where he served as senior vice president of marketing and sales and as vice president of the Microcomputer Systems division. He is also the author of ""Marketing High Technology"" and ""Total Customer Service,"" as well as co-author of ""The Virtual Corporation."" He holds a Ph.D. in electrical engineering from Stanford.

</a> <br/>
The 2008 financial crisis highlighted the critical role that credit rating agencies (CRAs) play in global capital markets. Post-crisis, policymakers on both sides of the Atlantic have introduced a wide range of new regulations intended to improve the oversight or regulation of CRAs. In the United States, Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Act hoping to increase CRA oversight and reduce conflicts of interest, while increasing disclosure requirements. Meanwhile, the European Commission pursued two rounds of legislation focused on mitigating conflicts of interest, enhancing transparency and empowering a new pan-European supervisor. <br/>
<br/>
Concerned about the role that CRAs played in the European sovereign debt crisis, the European Commission on November 15, 2011, proposed a third round of significant amendments to existing EU regulations - referred to as CRA3. While the stated intention of CRA3 is to further increase competition, accountability and transparency, there are questions regarding the efficacy and unintended consequences of the proposals, which may have an impact not just in Europe but throughout global debt markets. <br/>
<br/>
In partnership with the International Centre for Financial Regulation (ICFR), the Center for Financial Markets at the Milken Institute convened a roundtable discussion in Paris to discuss in depth the merits and potential pitfalls of the proposed regulations. The roundtable participants included a diverse group of stakeholders, including institutional investors, corporate issuers, regulatory officials, legal experts, ratings agencies, special advisors to sovereigns and financial institutions, and academics. <br/>
<br/>
While views differed on various aspects of the proposed regulations, concerns were expressed that in many instances the proposed regulations could have the opposite effect of that intended by policymakers - that is, increased costs to issuers or investors, reduced quantity and quality of ratings, and the balkanization of global regulations. The aggregate effect of these outcomes could reduce the depth and liquidity of capital markets. The participants largely agreed, therefore, that the proposed CRA3 required further consideration before adoption by the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers.<br/>",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,4,10,2012,NULL,NULL,0,NULL,Paris<br><i>By invitation only</i>,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,1,0,0,0,1,NULL,"{length = 8, bytes = 0x0000000000240f89}",NULL,NULL,NULL,2012-03-02 10:13:39.540,2012-03-02 10:13:39.540,2012-04-10 00:00:00.000,NULL,NULL,41007,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

Rapid globalization and advances in information technology have changed how nations, corporations, and individuals innovate. ""To innovate or die"" has become an unofficial mantra in the 21st century; a powerful economic and social force that can help solve some of the world's greatest challenges, ranging from natural resource scarcity to economic growth and job creation. <br>
<br>
The new rules of innovation require open and networked models of information exchange, as well as efficient sharing and use of available data. But even innovation has its barriers in today's society, and some question the extent to which the ideas economy impacts the real economy. <br>

</table>As the U.S. ambassador to Syria, Robert Ford knows first-hand about the dramatic revolution and government counter-offensive taking place there. <p> 

At this private breakfast for Milken Institute Associates, Ford discussed U.S. policy toward Syria, engagement with the Syrian opposition movements, and efforts to achieve consensus at the United Nations and alleviate the humanitarian crisis precipitated by the brutality of the Syrian regime.<p> 

Ford's appearance came at the one-year mark of the revolution in Syria, where his visits to protests and the funeral of a slain activist drew sharp criticism from the state-run media last year &mdash; and an alarming attack on his motorcade. Since his evacuation from Syria in late October 2011, Ford has continued to criticize the regime. <p>

Ambassador Ford is a career member of the Senior Foreign Service. Previously he served as the deputy chief of mission at the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad as well as political counselor in 2008-2009 and 2004-2006. He worked on three rounds of Iraqi elections and the preparation of the new Iraq Constitution.  In 2006-2008 he served as ambassador to Algeria, and in 2001-2004 he was deputy chief of mission to Bahrain, helping to negotiate a free trade agreement. <p>

Fluent in French and Arabic, Ford joined the Foreign Service in 1985 and has also served in Turkey, Egypt and Cameroon. He was a Peace Corps volunteer in Morocco from 1980-1982. Ford has received numerous honor awards from the Department of State and from the Department of Defense for his service in Iraq. He holds a master's degree from The Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. <p>

Richard Sandor wants to make it clear that ""derivative"" is not a dirty word. It's one motivation behind his latest book, <a href=""http://www.richardlsandor.com/"">""Good Derivatives: A Story of Financial and Environmental Innovation.""</a>
<p>It's a case that Sandor is well-equipped to make. As a young economist at the Chicago Board of Trade, he helped create interest rate futures-derivatives that revolutionized worldwide finance. Later, he pioneered the use of emissions trading to reduce acid rain and greenhouse gases, creating the Chicago Climate Exchange and affiliated exchanges in Europe and China.

<p>At this Milken Institute Forum, Sandor will discuss how financial innovation has been a force for good in the last 40 years and how its vast potential can address environmental, health and social challenges in the next 40 years.

447,NULL,Opportunities for Growth: Leveraging the Power of the Bio-Economy,Leveraging the Power of the Bio-Economy,finlabs,"Advances in biological science, rising oil prices and renewed interest in environmental sustainability have all converged to create demand for bio-based products and chemicals. Creating a new bio-economy represents a crucial opportunity to generate industry growth and support job creation.<p> 

In partnership with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Milken Institute convened a Financial Innovations Lab in Washington, D.C. to focus on innovative market strategies to increase investment and support growth in production and capacity of new bio-based products.<p> 

Bio-based products and chemicals can often be produced in fewer steps than their fossil-based counterparts. And despite early disappointments in profits from the biofuels market, there is healthy interest in biochemicals and next-generation fuels and products, which often have stronger profit margins and solid market demand. As economic growth returns, there will be a substantial increase in demand for these bio-based products.<p>

The Lab explored the most effective models for public-private partnerships and potential mechanisms to foster collaborations and attract new investment. It brought together a diverse group of experts and decision-makers from government agencies, industry, academia, technology and finance. The session included discussions led across departments at the USDA, including Rural Development; Research, Education and Economics; and the office of the Chief Economist.<p>

The goal is to create a flexible, market-oriented and efficient system that will increase sources of capital.<p>

With that goal in mind, the Lab ""Social Investment to Address Israel's Growing Needs"" brought together a diverse group of experts and decision-makers from impact investing and venture philanthropy including representatives from the Israeli government, private investors, academics, philanthropists and social entrepreneurs.<p>

Overcoming challenges from education to environmental sustainability to health care has largely been the purview of the public sector and the philanthropic community, but these sources lack the funding to fully address these issues. Many of the financial tools for funding social infrastructure are unavailable in Israel, so the nonprofits that deliver most of these services cannot reach the scale necessary to have a lasting impact.<p> 

Learning from best practices from the United States and abroad, the Lab participants reviewed the most effective strategies to leverage private dollars for social purposes. Some examples:<p>

<li> Grand Challenges Canada would like to extend its challenge program to social entrepreneurs in Israel, offering $100,000 grants for products and services that can scale up and fill an unmet health-care need, including services outside Israel. For example, one recent grantee proposes to develop a fetal monitor product that does not require electricity (For information: <a href=""http://www.grandchallenges.ca/"">www.grandchallenges.ca</a>).<p> 

<li> A pay-for-outcomes model has been used in a pilot project in England. A bond's value is based on project outcomes. The bond pays no return if the project fails to reduce recidivism in a targeted prison population. But if recidivism drops by 7.5 percent, the British government will pay an ""avoided cost"" amount, and the bond will return a market rate to lenders (For information: <a href=""http://www.socialfinance.org.uk/"">www.socialfinance.org/uk</a>).<p> 

<li> Double-bottom-line investing involves venture capital investing for both market returns and other outcomes - job creation, products for healthy living, community programs and so on. One fund, DBL Investors, is in the top quartile of its fund cohort - illustrating that there need not be a compromise between doing good and doing well (For information: <a href=""http://dblinvestors.com/"">www.dblinvestors.com</a>).<p> 

<li> Creation of for-profit businesses that reinvest a share of their profits in job training programs. Liliyot is a Tel Aviv restaurant that excels in its field - kosher dining - and its social mission - creating an on-ramp for at-risk youth. The enterprise partners with Elem, a nonprofit that provides youth counseling services. Liliyot investors still expect a return on capital, and the business plans to expand to nearly a dozen restaurants (For information: <a href=""http://www.liliyot.co.il/"">www.liliyot.co.il</a>).<p>

The global health community has made great strides in eradicating deadly diseases, but there is significant work yet to be done. There is an urgent need for vaccines and treatments to combat diseases like tuberculosis and malaria that disproportionately affect developing nations, but there is not enough investment to speed their development.   <br>
<br>
<p>How can we channel capital to fund this discovery and innovation? What are the most effective models for financing and partnership? Over the past decade, there have been many promising developments in terms of collaboration and market-based incentives, but a huge funding gap remains. How can we expand innovations like product development partnerships and advance market commitments to attract capital from investors not typically engaged in the sector? Can we engage sovereign wealth funds and other institutional investors as well as a broader network of philanthropies and aid organizations? 
<p>

To answer these questions and advance solutions, the Milken Institute convened a Financial Innovations Lab, held with support from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, to bring together a diverse group of stakeholders in the global health space to map out implementation strategies for scaling up innovative financing mechanisms to fund R&D. <p>  
The Lab discussions seemed to revolve around a common theme: The enormity of the challenges facing the global health field has necessitated a variety of financial models and solutions that could benefit from more efficient coordination across the entire R&D value chain. While this can make for a very broad conversation, it also demonstrates the great depth of the innovation in this space. For example, the conversation moved from traditional aid models, to innovations that can make philanthropic funding more effective, to pure capital market mechanisms. These include: <p>
<li>Identifying which areas of global health R&D are appropriate only for straight grant funding and which areas are ripe for innovative financing.<br>
<li>Making government aid and foundation capital more effective through (a) new applications for the Advance Market Commitment and the International Finance Facility for Immunization models and (b) more innovative financing in the form of program and mission-related investments to provide credit enhancements and equity positions for global health R&D.<br>
<li>Utilizing public and private capital through financial models, from the newly established JP Morgan Global Health Investment Fund to a blended capital public-private partnership to a fixed-income security that could attract large institutional investors.<p>

Because of the multi-faceted nature of the discussion, the Institute looks forward to continuing the conversation to promote clarity and support implementation of existing and proposed models. <p>

Now he is curating his next massive undertaking: ""Israel: Portrait of a Work in Progress.""<p> 
At this Forum by the Milken Institute Israel Center, Brenner will preview and discuss this extraordinary photo-documentary project by 12 acclaimed photographers who spent up to six months in residence in Israel. The event is part of the Israel Center's ongoing series, ""From Startup Nation to Global Nation.""<p> 
For the past decade, Brenner has planned, executed and produced this project documenting different aspects of Israel's reality. The photographers were charged with looking beyond the political narrative and exploring Israel in a way that reveals and questions but doesn't judge its complexity and inequities.<p> 
According to Brenner, the project seeks ""to provide a penetrating vision of Israel as a living organism, with all its rifts and paradoxes."" The Financial Times, New York Times and Ha'aretz have published major articles on the project, and a touring exhibit will begin in 2014. <p>
Brenner's work has been the subject of solo exhibitions at the International Center of Photography, New York; the Rencontres Internationales de las Photographie, Arles; and the Musee De L'Elysee, Lausanne. A recipient of the 1992 Prix de Rome, Brenner directed the original film ""The Last Marranos"" and has published several books, including ""Exile at Home"" (1998), ""Jews/America/Representation"" (1996) and ""Marranes"" (1992). <p>

457,NULL,Federal Guarantee Customization Workshop,Federal Guarantee Workshop ,Forums,"The federal government guarantees almost $1 trillion in small business, housing, energy and other loans annually.  Better targeting of federal credit support programs is one way to address the credit risk problems that impede the flow of credit to underserved markets.  However, loans to underserved borrowers may  increase guarantee losses and corresponding ""credit subsidy"" costs - an important disincentive for federal policymakers.<p> 

Many states and localities have instituted their own credit enhancement programs to serve borrowers - and lenders - not adequately served by federal credit support.    But, unlike the federal government, states are prohibited from pledging their credit on behalf of private interests.  Instead they must back their guarantee programs with funded, but unrated, accounts that are typically 10 to 20 times larger than the credit subsidy for similar federal programs. As result, state programs offer credit risk protection that is both inferior and more expensive than federal initiatives.  <p>

Allowing states and localities to obtain federal backing for their programs by paying the associated credit subsidy costs would make state programs less expensive and more appealing to lenders.  At the same time, it would permit federal credit agencies to target programs more effectively to underserved markets. <p>

Toward that end, the Federal Guarantee Customization Workshop will bring together government officials, federal credit executives, lenders, institutional investors, and finance professionals to develop the framework of a pilot ""customization"" program aimed at addressing underserved markets in California. <p>  

Participants will help shape policy and program proposals designed to allow: <p>

<li>Banks and other lenders to extend credit into underserved markets without incurring significantly increased risk<p>

<li>States and localities to improve the capacity and quality of credit enhancement programs at reduced public cost<p>

<li>Federal agencies to increase the effectiveness of federal credit programs without additional cost federal taxpayers<p>

<li>Investors and finance professionals to gain insight into the opportunities created by the emergence of a new class of federally-guaranteed assets<p>

The event's organizers are The Milken Institute; the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco's community development arm; Wall Street Without Walls, a national program to help community economic development organizations access the capital markets; and Capital Access Group, a network of finance and public policy professionals specializing in adapting proven financing techniques and structures to underserved markets. <p>

Apple, the world's most valuable company, is famously secretive. Of course, it's one thing to keep details of next-generation products from gadget-obsessed fans. It's another to keep a new employee in the dark about what job they've been hired to do.<br>

<p>At this Milken Institute Forum, Lashinsky will reveal the secrets and strategies that have allowed Apple to churn out hit after hit and inspire a cult-like following for its products, and he'll give his view on what's ahead for Apple in a post-Jobs world.
<p>It's a story Lashinsky is well-qualified to tell. A long-time tech reporter, Lashinsky predicted in 2008 that the then unknown Tim Cook would succeed Jobs as CEO. Perhaps the best testimonial is that Walter Isaacson, who is well-versed in all things Apple as the author of the acclaimed biography ""Steve Jobs,"" is enthusiastic about ""Inside Apple.""

Women entrepreneurs are a growing force in the economy. Between 1997 and 2011, the number of women-owned businesses in the United States grew at twice the rate of men-owned firms. Nevertheless, one of the fundamental challenges facing any entrepreneur today is finding the capital to launch and grow a business. Do women entrepreneurs face unique challenges or issues in obtaining start-up financing and growth capital? Are there policy or market solutions that can help to facilitate the flow of capital or credit to start-up enterprises and small businesses, especially those owned by women?

<p> The battle between Mirage Resorts and Trump Resorts over Renaissance Point, now known as the Marina District, raged from 1995 to 2000. Bronson sat on Mirage's board and served as president of New City Development Company, the subsidiary responsible for developing Mirage Resorts projects outside Nevada.

One of the Institute's keys to success is its ability to bring together experts in some of the world's most pressing topics for thoughtful, practical conversations that focus on solutions to challenges -- often financial and economic matters that affect how the world's markets operate.
<P> That's once again the case with this private breakfast for Milken Institute Associates -- featuring a discussion among Perry Wong, the Institute's director of research; Keith Savard, senior managing economist; and Komal Sri-Kumar (""Sri""), MI senior fellow and chief global strategist of Trust Company of the West (TCW).
<P> These experts will offer their views on what's behind the slowing U.S. economy , its implications for the presidential election based upon current research displaying the strong historical relationships, and the continuing European debt crisis, including impacts on the emerging economies. Institute Associates will have an opportunity to hear what they have to say and ask questions.
<P> Wong helps lead the Institute's research projects. He is an expert on regional economics, development and econometric forecasting, and specializes in analyzing the structure, industry mix, development and public policies of a regional economy.
<P> Savard brings to the Institute his expertise in evaluating the interrelationship between economic fundamentals and activity in global financial and commodity markets. He also has a background in sovereign risk analysis and applying a disciplined economic approach to investment-portfolio decision-making.
<P> Sri-Kumar serves as chairman of TCW's Comprehensive Asset Allocation portfolio and is an Institute senior fellow. At TCW, Sri-Kumar has been key to raising assets for a number of TCW strategies from sovereign wealth funds, international agencies, corporate and public pension funds, and retail investors. He frequently contributes to the Institute's blog, Currency of Ideas.

</table>
The best way to improve society is not by reviling finance but by reclaiming it for the public good, economist Robert Shiller argues in his latest book, ""Finance and the Good Society.""
<p>His views may seem counterintuitive in the wake of the great financial meltdown, but Shiller makes a powerful case for finance as a tool for solving society's greatest challenges and increasing general well-being. For instance, finance is responsible for such inventions as insurance, mortgages, savings accounts and pensions. The need is for more financial innovation, not less, he argues, and finance should play a larger role in helping society achieve its goals.
<p>At this Milken Institute Forum, Shiller took part in a wide-ranging discussion with the Institute's Peter Passell about ""Finance and the Good Society,"" the outlook for the economy in general and his forecast for housing in particular. <br>
  Shiller is no apologist for the excesses of the financial sector. He is perhaps the only economist to have predicted not only the real estate bubble that led up to the subprime mortgage meltdown but also the stock market bubble of 2000. In real estate circles, he is perhaps best known as one of the developers of the Case-Shiller home-price index.

At this discussion and reception for Milken Institute Associates - just one week after the general election - these two experts are sure to have strong opinions about where the victor's priorities might take the country and what economic pitfalls may lay ahead. They will also discuss the continuing European debt crisis and the impact on both developed and emerging economies.<p>

Few people are better qualified to look into the economic crystal ball. <p>

Bernstein, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, was the chief economist and economic adviser to Vice President Joe Biden and executive director of the White House Task Force on the Middle Class. Previously he was a senior economist and the director of the Living Standards Program at the Economic Policy Institute in Washington, D.C., and deputy chief economist at the U.S. Department of Labor. He is the author and co-author of numerous books, including ""Crunch: Why Do I Feel So Squeezed?"" and nine editions of ""The State of Working America.""

<P>
In the last 50 years, a significant reduction in tariffs on the trade of goods and merchandise has resulted in increased trade volumes and contributed to overall global GDP growth. Global trade in services has also grown significantly, now accounting for about 30 percent of U.S. exports; however, barriers to trade in services still exist, and these obstacles could potentially hinder opportunities for future economic growth. 
<P>
This briefing explored how policymakers can promote service trade liberalization while addressing the myriad of legal and regulatory hurdles and other policy considerations.<p>

Is energy self-sufficiency a realistic goal for the United States? In his latest book, expert Gal Luft argues that energy independence is a pipedream that will have little or no effect on the price Americans pay at the pump.
<p>Luft and co-author Anne Korin p
  oint to the fact that, over the past seven years, domestic oil production has expanded, vehicle fuel-efficiency has increased and oil imports have fallen. Yet the amount Americans spend on oil imports has skyrocketed. True energy security requires an uninterrupted energy supply and affordable prices, he argues, and energy self-sufficiency guarantees neither.
<p>At this Milken Institute Forum, Luft, the co-director of the Institute for the Analysis of Global Security, explained the reason for the collapse in the energy security paradigm and how the U.S. can avoid the pitfalls of today's cartel-dominated oil market.<br/>

At the height of Pax Americana, the man credited with liberating Europe a few years earlier presided over the era of McCarthyism and ""Howdy Doody"" with a bland, reassuring demeanor. Some thought Dwight D. Eisenhower was in over his head. Yet he boldly wielded the nation's new thermonuclear arsenal as a tool of geopolitical strategy and persuasion. The hydrogen bomb was a weapon that could not be used, author Evan Thomas explains, but gave Ike a powerful bluff in the service of enforcing stability and averting war.<br>

<p> At this Milken Institute Forum, authors A.G. Lafley (P&G's former CEO) and Roger Martin (dean of Toronto's Rotman School of Management) will explain the strategy behind one of the most successful corporate turnarounds of the century and how leaders of companies big and small can use these techniques in their own organizations.
<p> The authors boil down the strategy to two factors--where to play and how to win--and demonstrate how P&G repeatedly won by applying this method to iconic brands such as Olay, Bounty, Gillette, Swiffer and Febreze.

Important work is under way nationally to explore and improve the higher education landscape, and this roundtable aims to showcase promising approaches and analyze new funding models and strategies.  Going forward, how will the United States structure and finance higher education in a way that produces graduates who meet employer needs without saddling students with debt levels that they will struggle to repay? What lessons can we learn by looking abroad?  What is the role of prospective employers in promoting higher education?  And how can innovative solutions be implemented?<p>

To answer these questions and others, we will bring to the table key stakeholders with diverse perspectives, including policymakers, institutional investors, human resource experts, administration officials, corporate executives, leading academics, banks, budget and labor economists, university representatives, consumer advocates, education experts, and trade associations.  Key findings and conclusions from the disucssion will be captured in a published and widely disseminated report.<p>

518,NULL,Reinventing Israeli Capital Markets:  Creating a Financial Platform for Global Growth ,Lab: Reinventing Israeli Capital Markets,finlabs,"Israel's entrepreneurs capture a limited part of the global technology value chain, generally involving high-end R&D. At the same time, Israel's capital markets are suffering from a decline in liquidity and a decrease in portfolio investment. As a result, Israel's long-term growth is restricted, since innovation in the technology sector creates a multitude of economic ripple effects.<p>

By increasing access to capital for small and medium-size firms, Israel can meet the needs of capital-constrained companies and strengthen the country's position as a global incubator. <p>

Toward this end, the Milken Institute convened a Financial Innovations Lab in May that brought together institutional investors, asset managers, finance experts and decision-makers from the Israeli government. Participants discussed a wide range of options and interventions that would encourage capital productivity among both Israeli and non-Israeli firms and expand related export industries.  <p>

The Lab began with presentations and discussion about the current investing landscape in Israel. Eugene Kandel, head of Israel's National Economic Council; Shmuel Hauser, chairman of the Israel Securities Authority; and Oded Sarig, head of the Capital Markets Division in the Ministry of Finance, gave an overview of the current challenges in jumpstarting new investment, especially in high-growth industries. <p>

Participants then shared best practices for developing middle-market companies, lessons learned from Israel's ongoing transition from a startup economy to a global market-driven economy, and strategies for increasing market size and liquidity, direct private equity and portfolio investment flows. <p>

At the conclusion of the Lab, participants outlined financial and regulatory models - business development corporations (BDCs), venture trusts, project development bonds and other innovative trading platforms, and fund structures -that the government could enact to create more liquidity. <p>
<i>Results from the Lab, including recommended next steps for implementation, will be published soon. For information, contact Caitlin MacLean, associate director of Financial Innovations Labs, at <a href=mailto:cmaclean@milkeninstitute.org>cmaclean@milkeninstitute.org</a>.</i><p>

520,NULL,Structuring a Catalytic Financing Facility for Nutrition ,Lab: Financing for Nutrition,finlabs,"Undernutrition is the largest single contributor to child mortality worldwide, a factor in one-third of deaths among children younger than 5. Less well-known is the fact that undernutrition also costs billions of dollars in health-care expenditures and lost productivity, which severely encumbers regional and global competitiveness. Yet undernutrition remains one of the most overlooked, under-prioritized and underfunded issues in global development despite the existence of cost-effective interventions.<p> 

Addressing undernutrition in the developing world is not only an investment in health but also in long-term economic growth. The funding gap for preventive and treatment measures is an estimated $10.3 billion.<p>

To bridge the gap, a steering committee was formed in early 2013 at the request of the Scaling Up Nutrition (SUN) donor network and charged with developing proposals for a catalytic financing facility. The aim is to attract new capital to accelerate results and increase longer-term, country-led financial support.<p>

As part of this effort, the Milken Institute convened a two-day Financial Innovations Lab in London to determine whether a catalytic facility of this kind is needed and to debate its goals, activities and structure. Lab participants included a broad mix of government representatives from countries most affected by undernutrition, bilateral and multilateral donors, foundations, representatives of private businesses, and finance and nutrition experts.<p>

Participants discussed the proposed facility partnering with a limited number of high-burden countries to accelerate the rollout of large, prioritized, high-impact nutrition programs. The objectives were to demonstrate that results at scale can be achieved rapidly and cost effectively while leveraging additional resources from domestic sources and donors.<p>

And the team brought us victory,"" he said at a post-landing press conference.
<p> At this Milken Institute Forum, Elachi will discuss that particular victory, his storied career in space exploration and the remarkable work that JPL is doing as it monitors its existing 23 spacecraft across the solar system and prepares for the next generation.

526,NULL,Modernizing the U.S. Corporate Tax System: Implications for Financial Markets,Briefing: U.S. Corporate Tax System,Forums,"The United States has the highest statutory corporate tax rate among all industrialized nations. At 39.1 percent (combined federal and average state rates), the U.S. statutory corporate tax rate is more than 14 percentage points higher than the OECD average of 25 percent in 2012. While the effective rate is lower, many believe the statutory rate should be reduced for the U.S. to remain competitive in modern global markets. The U.S. is also the only G8 country that maintains a worldwide tax system on earnings from foreign markets as opposed to a territorial tax system.<p> 

This briefing will address how modernizing the corporate tax system will impact the financial markets: How does the current corporate income tax system create investment distortions? How would changes to the treatment of interest affect the mix of debt vs. equity financing? What impact would a territorial tax system have on U.S. competitiveness and cross-border investments? And how would stronger economic growth impact financial markets overall?<p>

527,NULL,Reforming Israel's Film Incentives Program,Roundtable: Israel Film Incentives,Forums,"Israel has missed out on business creation and jobs stemming from the expansion of the film and television industry around the globe. Despite Israel's vibrant emerging film and television industry, its existing incentives, based on the country's 2008 Law for the Encouragement of the Production of Films, have proven ineffective in attracting new projects.<p> 

Other countries have succeeded by providing lower costs, through tax benefits and production infrastructure along with operational support, while also marketing their landscape, utilities, tourism facilities and local film production services. <p>  

The Israeli government faces the challenge of developing a competitive financial offering that ensures continuity of the film industry's production cost environment over time. Countries like Ireland and the Czech Republic have lost global production share as incentives expired. And the lack of stable production incentive tax regimes in some U. S. states and other foreign countries creates an opportunity for Israel to provide a stable, predictable, secure film/television production environment. <p>  

To craft a formula for success, the Milken Institute convened a roundtable discussion of experts, including heads of production from studios and networks, producers, agents, senior legal counsel, and senior Israeli officials from the Ministries of Finance, Industry, Trade and Employment and Foreign Affairs.

Israel possesses one of the highest concentrations of archaeological resources in the world. Cultural heritage drives tourism and development throughout the country. However, the true economic value of these assets has yet to be realized. Funding challenges, ongoing maintenance difficulties and an inability to generate revenue prevent these important resources from being leveraged to provide local and national economic growth.<p>

At the same time, both the public and private sectors wish to support new models that can appropriately value and utilize cultural resources. Learning from best practices in financing economic development, there are mechanisms that can leverage current heritage funding initiatives into a sustainable pool of capital for a variety of project types and capital needs. Heritage asset districts, for example, are a region-based solution for economic development that can create a sustainable balance between preservation, conservation and development. <p>

Building on the Institute's previous work exploring potential models that incentivize investment in cultural heritage, the Lab focused on creating heritage asset districts to utilize the value of cultural heritage to spur economic development in communities throughout Israel while simultaneously ensuring the conservation of priceless national treasures. Lab participants reviewed the potential projects, as well as the structure and organization of the model, and advised on the necessary steps to implement such a model in the near term. Participants included representatives from the Prime Minister's Office, the Ministry of Finance, and the Antiquities and National Parks authorities, as well as experts in economic development and the tourism industry.<p>

Results from the Lab, including recommended next steps for implementation, will be published soon.

Israel's economic growth has been inadequate and shared unequally. This pattern of inequality is being exacerbated by a decline in charitable giving, the government's growing deficits and diminished resources, and the struggle by many nonprofit organizations to effectively serve their communities. Meanwhile, many businesses that could accelerate Israel's lagging growth rate suffer from declining investment that affects the nation's exports.

The launch of impact-investment platforms, programs, products and policies, coupled with Israel's technological and social-innovation strengths, make this an exciting time for Jewish communities abroad to engage with leaders in Israel. This half-day seminar brought together experts in the field to review today's state of affairs and create opportunities to work together.
<p> The workshop's goals:
<p>
<li> Help to ensure that Israel remains a center of social innovation to solve problems of scarcity at home and abroad. <br>
<li>Leverage charitable dollars through program-related and impact investing.<br>
<li>Generate measurable social, financial and/or environmental returns. <br>
<li>Discuss how to use charitable and government funds leveraged by private capital through matching and structured finance to solve pressing social, community and environmental challenges in Israel. <br>
<li> Address philanthropic, policy and program development innovations to address capital scarcity for nonprofit, profit-for-purpose and for-profit enterprises that create positive social and environmental outcomes while securing Israel's economy and place in the world. Leverage philanthropic endowments to catalyze financial return and social impact. Enable donors to develop impact-based investment models for social change and align their portfolio management with their philanthropic mission. <br>
<li> Create concrete portfolio strategies to activate capital for program-related (below-market-rate returns) and mission-related (market-rate return) projects that create double-bottom-line returns (blending social and financial returns) focusing on social investment funds, social impact bonds (performance-based), and social investment intermediaries to make Israel a leader in impact investment.

Development Finance (Roundtable - Invitation Only) </b>
<p>

The world's economic center of gravity is shifting from the developed to the developing world. Demographic trends and increased productivity add up to great potential for growth in emerging and frontier markets in Asia, Latin America, Africa and the former Soviet bloc. Significant capital is needed to support entrepreneurs, job formation, technology deployment, and new systems for delivery and expansion. This type of international development is facilitated in part by a network of multilateral development finance agencies. They can deploy a broad range of tools and programs, including wholesale and retail loans, equity support, insurance and guarantees. What are the most effective mechanisms to engage the public and private sectors in driving this growth story forward? This breakfast will bring together experts in development finance to discuss the most effective models for collaboration between governments, corporations and emerging market stakeholders to scale up economic growth.<p>

<b>Impact Investing: Israel as a Launching Pad for Social Investment</b><p>

Why is impact investing a new and critical frontier for investors? This panel will be a lively discussion by financial, business and technology innovators in the impact investing sector. Impact investors believe that capital can be deployed in more effective and efficient ways to ensure lasting social, economic, and environmental impact. By aligning diverse interests through investment models and capital structures, a variety of emerging investment and business models enable investors, business, and social entrepreneurs to examine market and policy failures through the lens of finance and overcome them. Impact investors believe it's possible to solve social or environmental challenges while generating sustainable returns (both financial and social). Long-term investors, in particular, consider such factors as climate change, overcoming technological divides, health, workforce policies and economic conditions to be an essential part of effective risk management. These impact investors vary in size (from small funds to large institutions), in sector (from private capital to public agencies) and in approach (from exercising ownership to restructuring government funding through private-public partnerships). But they all recognize that investments can produce benefits or costs beyond the targeted financial returns, and that investors and society alike are better off when investment decisions include these multiple factors. Questions to be addressed include: Do social and environmental targets for investment require different forms of credit analysis? Does combining public-private and philanthropic investors enhance or diminish returns? What particular challenges face the formulation of investment targets and barriers to investment (regulatory, training, data, others)? The government has taken an important first step by formulating ideas for a social investment fund. How can this be scaled? What additional steps can be made to mobilize financial institutions through new initiatives or through capital markets with social impact bonds to further scale this new wave of investment activity?<p>

<b>Global Capital Markets </b><p>

More than three years since the onset of the global financial crisis and the Great Recession, capital markets remain volatile. Getting funded as an issuer and getting returns as investors have become an increasingly uncertain proposition. Many forces are driving this, from the euro zone's ongoing struggles in serial crisis management to deliberations in Washington between embarking on further deleveraging versus rebalancing supply and demand in the Treasury market. Why are financial crises increasing in frequency and severity? Will 2012's tepid growth become more dynamic? Will ""fiscal cliff"" negotiations become a game-changer? What will be the role of sovereign wealth funds and other institutional investors in driving change? Can developing and frontier capital markets pick up the slack in driving growth and business formation with the reversals in developed markets?<p>

The Prime Minister's Office and Ministry of Environment recently concluded a series of roundtables to promote sustainable growth engines and jobs through green technologies and cleaner energy. Combining information and communications technology, biotechnology, nanotechnology in food, water, and energy production will transcend boundaries of individual technologies and regional borders as new engines for economic growth. By ""greening"" existing industries and growing green industries in these fields, new products, services, infrastructure investment could accelerate growth and create a development platform of new exports. Our Milken Institute Fellows deployed to the Ministry of Environmental Protection and the Oil Fuel Substitutes Initiative will report out their work along with government and clean tech industry leaders seeking to carve new channels of capital to fuel green growth in Israel and beyond.<p>

<b>Early-Stage Financing for Accelerating Medical Solutions</b><br> (Roundtable- Invitation Only)<p>

Where will the capital come from to spur innovation in medical research? This session explores solutions to funding gaps and the evolution of collaborative financing models that involve industry, investors and philanthropy. It also discusses the changing role of VCs, prospects for biotechs in the IPO market and where investors see the best short- and long-term opportunities. Can incentives align to attract and sustain sufficient levels of capital to support R&D and bring new therapies and technologies to patients? Traditional investors in translational research (large- and medium-cap biopharmaceutical companies and life science-focused venture capital funds) are becoming increasingly risk averse in the face of escalating challenges in the drug development process. Dr. Roger Stein, Research Fellow at the MIT Financial Engineering Lab and head of Academic Research at Moody's will present some breakthrough work done with his colleagues on securitization structures for financing cures. This important work pioneered by Dr. Stein, Prof. Andrew Lo and other colleagues was the subject of an important article in Nature Biotechnology. This work was first presented as part of a Milken Institute <a href=""http://www.milkeninstitute.org/pdf/FixesInFinancing.pdf"">Financial Innovations Lab</a> dedicated to this subject. <p>

536,NULL,Affordable Housing in Israel,Lab: Affordable Housing in Israel,finlabs,"Israelis face an extremely difficult housing market: Rentals are scarce and real estate is expensive. The struggle is exacerbated by the fact that a dramatic rise in housing costs over the past five years has not been matched by an increase in average household incomes.<p> 

At the same time, public housing solutions have dwindled over the last few decades. Worse still, investors are increasingly attracted to the luxury home market - largely for foreign buyers - which puts pressure on developers to increase profits at the expense of providing affordable housing options.<p> 

All of these challenges underscore the complexities of the issue. Resolving them requires a new set of affordable housing instruments for policy and program development in Israel.<p> 

Toward this end, the Milken Institute Israel Center is convening a Financial Innovations Lab to craft a roadmap that will help mobilize new sources of private capital, leverage current capital already committed to the housing market, and create tools for communities and local governments to engage developers in creating public-private partnerships for affordable housing.<p>

Lab participants - including government representatives from entities such as the National Economic Council and Ministries of Finance and Housing, private-sector investors, academics, philanthropists and social entrepreneurs - will review best practices from abroad and design funding models that can leverage public funding with private capital to increase access to financing for affordable housing. The diverse cross-section of attendees will help focus the discussion on the actual application and implementation of solutions as well as the required policy and regulatory adjustments.<p>


Results from the Lab, including recommended next steps for implementation, will be published soon. For information, contact Caitlin MacLean, associate director of Financial Innovations Labs, at <a href=""mailto:cmaclean@milkeninstitute.org"">cmaclean@milkeninstitute.org.</a><p>

How do economies, and individuals, thrive? It's largely a matter of values and motivations, in the view of Nobel laureate Edmund Phelps. At this private Milken Institute event, presented in partnership with RAND Corporation, the renowned economist will offer a sweeping argument about what makes nations prosper and why those sources of affluence are in jeopardy. That argument fills the pages of Phelps' new book, ""Mass Flourishing: How Grassroots Innovation Created Jobs, Challenge, and Change.""

</table><p>Phelps credits the Western world's prosperity to what he terms ""modern"" values, such as the desire to create, explore and meet challenges. That explosion of innovation and productivity gave rise to not only unprecedented wealth, but ""flourishing""--meaningful work, self-expression and personal growth. Yet the West's vigor is waning, threatened, he believes, by the return of values that stifle individual aspirations. Phelps asks whether industrialized nations will recommit themselves to modernity, grassroots dynamism and widespread personal fulfillment, or will only a few in those societies flourish.

550,NULL,The Impact of the Fed's Tapering Strategy on Global Markets,MATH Briefing: Tapering's Impact,Forums,"The surge in the Fed's balance sheet from $800 billion in September 2008 to almost $4 trillion currently has distorted global financial markets through the maintenance of near-zero interest rates, and through pushing investors - including households - to take on excessive risk to earn better returns. As a result, equity prices are higher than they would have been had only fundamentals mattered, bond yields are lower across the credit-rating spectrum, and there has been a troubling resurgence of covenant-light debt issuance. Internationally, emerging markets have benefited and suffered from the large and volatile capital flows that at times are driven more by Fedspeak than by global fundamentals. This briefing will address the most important medium-term impacts on global markets of the Fed's policy, the risks of prolonging near-zero interest rate/quantitative easing policies, and the associated pro and cons of the Fed's exit options.<p>

How do the nation's towns and cities pay to build parks, revamp blighted neighborhoods and keep retirement promises to employees? Five U.S. cities have gone bankrupt since 2010, including the once-mighty industrial engine of Detroit. Do other cities face a similarly grim future? What are their options?  How can a journalist investigate the fiscal solvency of cities on the beat? <p>

How does the Fed make monetary policy? This powerful institution, soon to have a new chairwoman, is arguably the most influential financial regulatory body in the world, yet its workings are a black box for most of us. The activities of the Central Bank affect interest rates on everything from credit cards to mortgages, the value of the U.S. dollar overseas and stock prices, with implications that touch every American. We'll look at the tools the Fed uses and how they work, including the federal funds rate, quantitative easing and more. <p>

Created by Congress in 1980 under the 1940 Investment Company Act, BDCs are not understood as clearly as mutual funds or REITs. However, while still a small part of the overall leveraged loan-market (less than 5 percent), BDCs have grown considerably since their inception and are now an important source of funding to small and middle-market companies. This session will explore in more detail the operating structure and investment strategies of BDCs and the implications for both small companies and BDC investors, how BDCs differ from REITs, the historical and projected evolution of the BDC market, the potential impact of legislative proposals on the BDC market, and the ability of small business to access capital. <p>

<b>Developing New Start-up Nations in Frontier Markets: New Drivers for Global Growth</b><br>
Youthful demographics, rising productivity and changing technology in emerging and frontier markets create enormous investment opportunities but also necessitate systemic change in structuring development finance. Great creativity is required for delivering solutions and expanding the necessary systems. This is especially true in the crucial areas of energy, health, water and food. Technologies need to be customized, financed and deployed on massive scales to make a difference in the lives of the vulnerable poor. Gaps also exist in financing tools and programs, including loans, equity support, insurance and more. Bridging them will require scientific proficiency, fresh business models, smart incentive structures, the tailoring of technology to local conditions and geographic and cultural awareness. In this roundtable, we'll discuss social and financial innovations in Africa, the Middle East, and Asia aimed at expanding growth.<p>

<b>Health Sciences as a Breakthrough Industry</b><br>
The financing gap for translational research is widening. High-risk, long-term investments are needed to turn medical innovations into lifesaving therapies. However, an industry-wide funding gap for early-stage drug development coupled with a retreat by venture investors from all but late-stage life sciences have created the need for new inventive, sustainable funding models. In order to accelerate medical solutions, novel approaches to early-state drug and device development are needed to better manage risk, lower capital cost, and improve research effectiveness, create diverse portfolios, leverage risk-tolerant capital and access new capital sources. In the last year, many of these approaches--from novel public-private partnerships to highly leveragable venture philanthropy investments to a new breed of institutional fund managers--have come into their own, with early data supporting an optimistic view of what's ahead. There is also a growing movement to apply nontraditional models as a disruptive force in biotech. Also, important financial research supports the ideas of extending medical financing beyond corporate R&D, venture and private equity to fixed income models for longer-term financing. How are these models improving the risk-return ratio for early-stage research, making it a more attractive opportunity? How does the involvement of philanthropic and/or government funding create leverage and attract greater private investment?<p>

<b>Milken Institute's Fellows Panel--Israel's Economic Growth Challenge: Bridging Gaps in Labor and Capital Productivity</b><br>
There is growing recognition that the growing productivity gap in Israel threatens future growth.  Since 1970 and worsening last year, the gap between Israel's productivity and the productivity of the G7 countries has steadily widened. Israel's capital formation is at the low end of OECD countries. The Bank of Israel has reported that low productivity is related to relative low investment rates in the Israeli economy resulting in the average Israeli worker having relatively low productive capital to utilize compared to workers in OECD countries. Israel's current productivity stands at 76 percent of the average labor productivity among OECD countries. Without changes in dismal standards of labor productivity performance and increases in capital investment, continued increases in income inequality and lack of job creation for a growing share of the educated workforce will challenge national economic security.<p>
A panel of key policy and research experts will respond and discuss key findings of Milken Institute Fellows' research over the past year to address these important challenges and these questions: Why are increases in educational attainment not translated into an increase in output per worker? Why is education not leading to faster economic growth? Why are the contribution of education to GDP and the standard of living declining? How can we ensure increase rates of return of investment in human capital--Israel's most critical growth resource? Are tax benefits encouraging capital investment working? How can the educational system act as a socioeconomic lever for growth?<p>

562,NULL,Housing Finance: Elements of Reform Necessary for Private Capital,MATH Briefing: Housing FInance,Forums,"At nearly $10 trillion, the housing finance market accounts for roughly 20 percent of the total U.S. financial market's $50 trillion in assets. Since the financial crisis, the U.S. government, through the GSEs, the Federal Housing Administration and the Department of Veterans Affairs, has backed the vast majority of new mortgages. Through the GSEs and Ginnie Mae, government agency issuance accounts for 98 percent of all mortgage-backed securities issuance. A renewed role for private capital is central to housing finance reform. This briefing will take a deeper, structural look at what reforms are needed to bring in private capital and ensure a smooth transition to a new housing finance system; what forms of private-sector participation will emerge and at what levels; and what changes to mortgage markets and instruments will be required.<p>

563,NULL,Who's in Charge of Translating Science into Cures? Understanding the Vital Importance of  Translational Research,NULL,Forums,"Every day we see stories in the media about the latest medical ""breakthroughs"" that could lead to cures for dreaded diseases. And yet, over the years, many breakthroughs like these have yet to bear fruit for patients.<p>
The fact is that many basic discoveries barely get to start the journey down the therapeutic development pipeline. Fascinating observations and creative insights often get lost in translation because they lack funding, incentives and technical expertise to advance any further. They get stuck in an ever-widening gap in funding and support for the kind of research that moves basic science down the path toward treatments. That translational gap has come to be called by many the ""Valley of Death."" <p>
According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), 80 percent to 90 percent of research projects fail before they ever get tested in humans. By industry's reckoning, the number may be even higher: For every 5,000 compounds tested, just five make it to clinical trials, and only one is ever approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Half of all experimental drugs in Phase III trials never become approved medicines.<p>
Translational research applies ideas, insights and discoveries generated through basic scientific inquiry to the treatment and prevention of disease. It is the critical bridge between basic research, the majority of which is led by the NIH, and clinical research, led by the biopharmaceutical industry.<p>
This expert panel will highlight the importance of translational research in the therapeutic development process and examine effective translational efforts, including progress at the newly created National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences at the NIH, which focuses on addressing scientific and technical challenges to reduce, remove, or bypass bottlenecks in the development of new treatments and tests that will ultimately improve human health.<p>

565,NULL,Breaking Past the Plateau: New Innovative Finance Models for Global Health,Lab: Financing Global Health,finlabs,"The interest in innovative finance has grown since the creation of the first advance market commitment over 10 years ago. Government spending continues to decline, and public- and private-sector investors alike are attempting to get the most leverage from their capital. As the financial product landscape develops, where are the new innovative financing mechanisms? How can we break past the plateau that has followed the success of models like IFFIm and prize competitions and take steps toward implementing the next generation of innovative finance?<p>

With a goal of promoting wider implementation among industry stakeholders, this Financial Innovations Lab brought together a small group of investors, donors and global health experts to review the nascent financial mechanisms aimed at making aid more efficient and effective and to design new models to engage the capital markets through various impact investing platforms. The session provided an opportunity to map out next steps toward increased adoption of the relevant models. <p>

Participants discussed the potential for more donor-based models, such as a social impact bond, to be applied to areas like malaria eradication, given the limited commercial market for drugs and treatments for the disease. For areas in global health that have more market opportunities, such as developing new vaccines for tuberculosis, participants discussed more traditional financing models such as venture capital, private equity and long-term debt models. <p>

Results from the Lab, including recommended next steps for implementation, will be published soon. For information, contact Caitlin MacLean, associate director of Financial Innovations Labs, at <a href=""mailto:cmaclean@milkeninstitute.org"">cmaclean@milkeninstitute.org<a/>.<p>

The demand for innovative infrastructure financing continues to grow, yet scaling up current programs and implementing new funding models has been slow to progress in the United States.<p>

With new proposed legislation at a national level and state programs beginning to spur investment, the time to plan for implementing new financing models is now. There has been some success in attracting private capital to augment public investment in infrastructure, from private activity bonds to the TIFIA program and state infrastructure banks, but whether and how current models and approaches can be adapted and scaled to attract the amount of investment needed remain open to debate.<p>

This Financial Innovations Lab, held in Washington, D.C., in coordination with the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Office of Energy Policy and New Uses,  will bring together a group of investors, government decision-makers and infrastructure experts to evaluate emerging financing models and craft recommendations to break past the log jams impeding implementation. Proposals for national or regional finance authorities, a national infrastructure bank or center of excellence, as well as the expansion of existing programs, including state financing agencies, will be vetted for viability and potential impact.

Once dependent on imported energy, the U.S. is expected to pass Saudi Arabia and Russia to become the world's largest oil producer. The wildcatters' success has transformed their personal lives as well. Like the Rockefellers and the Gettys before them, they're using their newfound wealth and power to influence politics, education, entertainment, sports, and many other fields. The revolution the frackers are responsible for has transformed the U.S. economy, raised environmental concerns, and upended global geopolitics. In some ways, their impact is just beginning.

</table><p> At this Milken Institute Forum, Zachary Karabell, a well-known money manager and author of ""The Leading Indicators: A Short History of the Numbers That Rule Our World,"" will discuss the origins of these pervasive statistics, their outsize influence and how they fail to capture the most essential information. As he'll explain, part of the problem is the absorption of the specific into the mass. The unemployment rate, for instance, means something different, or perhaps nothing at all, to working people of varied ages, regions, and educational levels.

<p> Karabell is particularly knowledgeable about the complex ties between the Chinese and American economies, and he'll construct a truer picture of that relationship beyond what he considers misleading trade numbers. Having sounded the alarm about indicators, Karabell believes the solution lies in the explosion of information in the digital era, which enables each of us to gather all the data we want and customize it to our needs.

</table><p> At this Milken Institute Forum, Kurtzman will contradict the glass-half-empty crowd that believes the nation's best days are behind it. His sunny prognosis is based on four forces that Kurtzman maintains will propel the U.S. to new heights of economic power and global influence. 
<p> So you think the country doesn't make anything anymore? The U.S. manufacturing sector is still the world's largest and most productive, Kurtzman points out. And the country is on its way to becoming a net exporter of energy. You think thirstier nations will soon outpace us? American talent and creativity are without peer in the world's fastest-growing economic sectors, and the companies and individuals who have been squirreling away cash through the downturn will soon unleash enormous amounts of capital into every part of the economy. 
<p> In reality, Kurtzman argues, America is on the precipice of one of its greatest growth spurts.

Although past rivals such as Bollywood and Hong Kong have been prolific in serving their home markets, they have had little impact on the economic underpinnings of Hollywood, least of all its feature film workforce.

The briefing, ""California's Position in State Tech and Science,"" took place in the capitol building in Sacramento and focused on the Milken Institute's <A HREF="" http://www.milkeninstitute.org/publications/publications.taf?function=detail&ID=38801451&cat=resrep"" target=""_blank"">publication</A> of the same title. Institute staff presented a look California's current scientific and technological business climate and suggested a path toward greater sustained growth.
<P>
Panelists included Raul Bocanegra, Assembly Member for California's 39th District; Robyn G. Hines, Sr., director of state government affairs for the Microsoft Corporation; Kevin Klowden, director of the Milken Institute's California Center; Kristen Olsen, Assembly Member for California's 12th District; and Michele Siqueiros, executive director of the Campaign for College Opportunity's Los Angeles office. Rob Lapsley, director of the California Business Roundtable, moderated the discussion.
<P>
The panelists pointed out that education reform is essential to improving California's ability to meet the needs of today's and tomorrow's high-tech employers. As the state's demand for high-tech jobs continues to grow, California is facing a serious technological deficit in its workforce. To combat this, panelists said, graduation requirements must include increased mathematics and computer science courses.
<P>
According to the panel, there is a serious lack of minority presence in high-tech career paths. African-American and Latino participation in advanced science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) classes is extremely low, pointing to a huge opportunity for these groups. The panelists suggested that resources be allocated to encourage minority pursuit of degrees that lead to high-tech jobs. Until California's education requirements are adjusted to reflect the needs of high-tech employers, the panelists do not expect these results to change.
<P>
The panelists acknowledged that the use of technology in the classroom has expanded in recent decades, but they went on to say that school systems must also seek to educate students on how technology works. Using technology should not be confused with creating technology. The panel recommended that school systems focus on teaching students how to produce and manipulate technology to expand their career opportunities.
<P>
Parental involvement was cited by the panelists as an essential ingredient to STEM success. Early exposure to science and technological-related activities encourages children to seek degrees and careers in high-tech fields. Engaging them in conversations about such topics as creating the next <A HREF="" https://minecraft.net/"" target=""_blank"">Minecraft</A> or Xbox will go a long way in starting young people down the path of a STEM career.
<P>
Education reform and parental involvement are not the only strategies the state can employ, according to the panel. Officials must also look to business leaders to create professional and mentoring opportunities for students seeking STEM degrees. By strengthening the relationship between degree-granting institutions and potential employers, the panelists said that graduates would have a wider set of opportunities. California's education system must lay out clear goals and guidelines to encourage investment from the business community. Universities with strong STEM programs are more likely to attract business expansion in these sectors to their regions.
<P>
The panel had some harsh comments for universities that have failed to implement strategic and efficient degree requirements. The Cal State system, for example, currently graduates in four years only 15 percent of students. Since most students require a fifth or even sixth year to graduate, students end up assuming considerable debt to pay for the additional years. This trend increases the risk of pricing lower and middle class families out of college degrees.
<P>
Returning to the importance of STEM education, the panel also cited a need for a grand strategy for reforming curricula. Smaller changes must be incorporated into a larger, long-term blueprint. A 10- to 15-year ""master plan"" for higher education is required for California, the panel agreed. The California university system enjoys a large degree of independence from legislative intrusion, but more oversight and metrics are required to ensure that an educated workforce is available for the growing demands of the high-tech sector.",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,3,27,2014,NULL,NULL,0,NULL,"Sacramento, CA", ,1,1,NULL,1,0,0,0,0,NULL,"{length = 8, bytes = 0x00000000002902ac}",NULL,NULL,NULL,2014-03-26 14:12:25.717,2014-03-26 14:12:25.717,2014-03-27 00:00:00.000,0,NULL,41723,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

Since the financial crisis, these companies have faced significant hurdles to securing traditional bank loans or equity investment. 
Banks are reluctant or restricted in their ability to provide critical lending, and the annual number of small company IPOs has faced a downward trend in the past few decades. A shifting regulatory landscape is further impacting opportunities to invest in America's SMEs (defined as fewer than 500 employees), and attracting new market participants.<p> 

This briefing will provide a landscape of the state of capital-raising for SMEs. We will discuss how innovative lending models are stepping in to provide critical capital to SMEs as traditional lenders alter the composition of their portfolios. We will also look at new securities registration exemptions, including Regulation A+, which will permit companies to raise up to $50 million from institutional and retail investors subject to a mini-IPO registration.

</table><p> Dysfunctional government has become clich&#233;, and most of us are resigned to the idea that nothing is ever going to change. John Micklethwait and Adrian Wooldridge of The Economist reveal that this is a very limited view of things. In fact, there have been three great revolutions in government in the history of the modern world, all led by the West. Now, we are in the midst of a fourth revolution, but the West is being left behind.
<P>
At this Milken Institute Forum, Micklethwait and Wooldridge point to a number of factors driving this revolution: the West's debt is unsustainable, the developing world has harvested all the low-hanging fruit, industrialization has transformed all the peasant economies it had left to transform, and the toxic side effects of rapid globalization are taking their toll around the world.
<P>
""The Fourth Revolution"" sheds light on this dual crisis of political legitimacy and political effectiveness and points toward the future. The authors offer a global tour of today's leading innovators in the exercise of power. The age of big government, they find, is over. The age of smart government has begun. Micklethwait and Wooldridge argue that a country's success depends overwhelmingly on its ability to reinvent the state. How is the West -- the U.S. in particular -- faring at this task? How is China doing? What dangers stem from Washington gridlock and the inefficiencies it has created?

<li> The tale of a woman whose son was shot by martial law troops, inspiring her to found the Tiananmen Mothers.<br>
<li> How one of the country's most senior politicians lost a family member to an army bullet.

Lim also uncovers the details of a brutal crackdown in a second Chinese city that until now has been a near-perfect case study in the state's ability to rewrite history.

As the state endures one of the worst droughts in recorded history, Southern California residents are looking for answers about the sustainability of the region's water supplies. Farmers have felt the sting of below-average rainfall for years, but as the crisis worsens, urban and suburban areas are likely to suffer drastic change in their relationship with the vital liquid.

</table>Wildfires and brown lawns may be increasingly common visual symptoms of drought, but unless the rains return to the Golden State (and stay awhile), Southern Californians can also expect to see food and water prices rise, battles over water rights intensify, and, likely, water use increasingly restricted. Will the drought bring about a new discussion of revising the current water pricing structure to reduce high consumption in residential areas? Gov. Jerry Brown has declared a state of emergency and requested a 20 percent reduction in use, but some cities have gone even further. Sacramento and other cities have begun levying substantial fines on residents who violate new statutes dictating when lawns may be watered.

605,NULL,Policy and California's Economy (PACE) Briefing Series: Small Business & Community Banking ,PACE,Forums,"On July 11, the Milken Institute California Center convened the latest in its series of Policy and California's Economy (PACE) briefings. Focused on issues affecting small businesses and community banking, the event continued conversations started at the Institute's California Summit in November. At the Summit, Small Business Administration (SBA) Administrator Maria Contreras-Sweet pointed out that the low capitalization levels at community banks in California inhibit lending to small and midsized businesses. The July roundtable focused on recommendations for reducing the barriers to business lending and streamlining the ways banks rate small business risk.
<P>
The roundtable brought together community banking representatives, small business owners and advocates, and public officials. SBA Regional Administrator Donna Davis joined California Center Director Kevin Klowden in facilitating the session. Attendees discussed characteristics of California in relation to SBA District 9 (comprising California and other Western states), especially in terms of the large role small businesses play in California employment as well as the broad diversity among small business owners in the state (California small businesses owned by women, minorities, and veterans).
<P>
Initial discussion focused on the systemic elements contributing to limitations in local lending, along with other risk assessment hurdles faced by small businesses. These include a general lack of resources, such as the structuring, licensing and permitting assistance that small businesses need in advance of funding. This condition has been highlighted by the recent rise of nontraditional funding sources driven by the lack of traditional financing. According to the roundtable speakers, contributing to this dynamic are limitations based on the current risk assessment structure, which were characterized as restrictive and lacking the flexibility needed by small businesses hoping to grow.
<P>
Roundtable participants identified both top-down and bottom-up approaches for widening access to capital. They made three recommendations involving potential government action.<br>
1.	Seek clarification concerning the procedural versus statutory requirements of local/community bank deposits.<br>
2.	Assess the landscape and viability of existing small-business-oriented lending mechanisms (e.g., expand the Small Business Investment Co.'s offerings and other unlevered mechanisms to provide additional sources of capital).<br>
3.	Develop campaigns to inform policymakers about the economic impact of small businesses and promote their multiplier effect in local communities.
<P>
Addressing additional regulatory hurdles impeding local lending, participants pointed to certain provisions in the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) that limit local institutions' ability to meet credit needs in certain communities. Pending CRA reform, it was suggested that the state may be able to assist local and community banks by providing structural support in overcoming geographic as well as other small to intermediate challenges. From a procedural standpoint, the roundtable encouraged the SBA, in relation to smaller community banks, to consider formalizing certain revisions to their standard operating procedures, allowing these banks to expand their ability to work with small businesses.
<P>
As discussed during the roundtable, these recommendations were intended as a starting point in improving the conditions that affect California's small business environment. The California Center plans to continue this conversation in September by convening a broader group, including additional state, federal and community banking partners. At that session, we will focus group efforts on the elements that inhibit small business growth while discussing strategies and areas of potential policy reform for the California Center to pursue.",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,7,11,2014,7,11,0,NULL,"Sacramento, CA",NULL,1,0,NULL,1,0,0,0,1,NULL,"{length = 8, bytes = 0x00000000002902ad}",NULL,NULL,NULL,2014-08-19 13:15:14.877,2014-08-19 13:15:14.877,2014-07-11 00:00:00.000,0,NULL,41829,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL
